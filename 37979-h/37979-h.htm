<h2 class="p6"><i>INTRODUCTION.</i></h2>

<p><i>Giovanni Verga was born at Catania, in
Sicily, in 1840. His youth was spent in
Florence and Milan. He afterwards lived
in Catania again, where he had an opportunity
of studying those types of the Sicilian
peasantry which he introduces so effectively,
and with such dramatic suggestion, into many
of his stories and sketches. After experiencing
grievous family losses he returned to
Milan, where he now resides.</i></p>

<p><i>In "L'Amante di Gramigna" Verga gives,
in the form of a letter to his friend, the novelist,
S. Farina, a sort of brief exposition of his
literary Creed. Much of the drama is left
to the imagination of the reader, who sees
through the lines the action hinted at in a
word or a phrase. Thus, in the story just
mentioned, no definite time-limit is assigned.
Months elapse, but only a passing expression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
gives the clue to it. It is amazing how definite
is the idea left in the mind. It gives all
the vividness of reality.</i></p>

<p><i>"Cavalleria Rusticana," or "Rustic Chivalry,"
has been known all over the world by
its operatic setting by Mascagni. "La Lupa,"
which is scarcely less strong and vital, has
been chosen by another Italian composer,
Puccini, as the subject for a two-act opera.
These two, as well as "L'amante di Gramigna"
and "Jeli il Pastore," illustrate the
deeper passions of the Sicilian peasantry.
Verga's sardonic humor is shown in "Gli
Orfani." How the sordid poverty of the people
stands out in the comparison between the
sorrow over the dying ass, and the utterly
materialistic grief at the loss of the painstaking
second wife!</i></p>

<p><i>"La Storia dell' Asino di San Giuseppe,"
well illustrates the average treatment of the
long-suffering, long-eared mules and asses
which make so picturesque a part of the scenery
of Italian and Spanish countries. It is a
document for the Society for the Prevention of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
Cruelty to Animals, and well deserves to be
circulated together with "Black Beauty."
What pathos in the sudden transfer of the
poor little beast from comparative comfort, at
least from the "dolce far niente" of its foalhood,
to the grim realities of life, and its
steady and fatal decline through all the gamut
of wretchedness and degradation, to die at
last under the weight of its burdens! And
what side glances on the condition of those unfortunate
Sicilians who live in what ought to
be the very garden and Paradise of the world,
and yet are so oppressed by unregulated
Nature and too well regulated taxes!</i></p>

<p><i>It is no land of the imagination into which
we are brought by Verga; there is no fascinating
glamour of the virtuous triumphing
after many vicissitudes, and seeing at last the
wicked adequately punished. Here it is grim
reality. The poor and weak go relentlessly to
the wall; innocence and humble ignorance are
crushed by experienced vice, the butterfly is
singed by the flame; there is little joy, little
peace. The fleckless sky shines down brilliantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
on wreck of home and fortune; the
son must go to the army, and the daughter to
her shame; the father's gray hairs must be
crowned with dishonor, and despair must
abide in the mother's breast. But yet the
stories are not wholly pessimistic, nor do they
give an utterly hopeless idea of the Sicilian
peasant. He shows his capabilities; the
woman her fiery zeal and faithfulness, even
when on the wrong track. You see that education
and a little real sympathy might make
a great people out of Verga's "Turiddus"
and "Alfios." There are dozens of others of
Verga's short sketches which would repay
translation, but the little collection of Sicilian
pictures here presented is marked by quite
wonderful variety and contrast. They well
illustrate the author's genius at its best.</i></p>

<p class="p6 center b1">NOTE.</p>

<p class="p2">Some of the Italian titles applied to the
characters in these stories are retained. They
are untranslatable; to omit them takes away
from the Sicilian flavor, which is their great
charm. Thus the words <i>compare</i> (<i>con</i> and
<i>padre</i>) and <i>comare</i> (<i>con</i> and <i>madre</i>), literally
godfather and godmother, are used in almost
the same way as "uncle" and "aunt" in our
country districts, only they are applied to
young as well as old; <i>gnà</i> is a contraction for
<i>signora</i>, corresponding somewhat to our <i>mis'</i>
for "Mrs." <i>Babbo</i> is like our "dad" or "daddie."
<i>Massaro</i> is a farmer; <i>compagni d'armi</i>
are district policemen, not quite the same as
<i>gens d'armes</i>; <i>Bersegliere</i> is the member of a
special division of the Italian army.</p>

<h2 class="p6">HOW PEPPA LOVED GRAMIGNA.</h2>

<p class="center b1 p6">UNDER THE SHADOW<br />
OF ETNA.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="b1">HOW PEPPA LOVED GRAMIGNA.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">1</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">D</span>ear Farina, this is not a story, but
the outline of a story.</p>

<p>It will at least have the merit of being
short, and of having fact for its foundation;
it is a human document, as the phrase goes
nowadays:&mdash;interesting perhaps for you
and for all those who study the mighty
book of the heart. I will tell it just as I
found it among the country paths, and in
almost the same simple and picturesque
words that characterize the tales of the
people; and really you will prefer to find
yourself facing the bare and unadulterated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
fact rather than being obliged to read between
the lines of the book through the
author's spectacles.</p>

<p>The simple truth of human life will
always make us thoughtful; will always
have the effectiveness of reality, of genuine
tears, of the fevers and sensations
that have inflicted the flesh. The mysterious
processes whereby conflicting passions
mingle, develop and mature, will long
constitute the chief fascination in the
study of that psychological phenomenon
called the plot of a story, and which
modern analysis tries to follow with scientific
care, through the hidden paths of
oftentimes apparently contradictory complications.</p>

<p>Of the one that I am going to tell you
to-day I shall only narrate the starting
point and the ending, and that will suffice
for you, as, perchance, some day it will
suffice for all.</p>

<p>We replace the artistic method to which
we owe so many glorious masterpieces by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
a different method, more painstaking and
more recondite; we willingly sacrifice the
effect of the catastrophe, of the psychological
result as it was seen through an
almost divine intuition by the great artists
of the past, and employ instead a logical
development, inexorably necessary, less
unexpected, less dramatic, but not less
fatalistic; we are more modest, if not more
humble; but the conquests that we make
with our psychological verities will not be
any less useful to the art of the future.
Supposing such perfection in the study of
the passions should be ever attained that
it would be useless to go further in the
study of the interior man, will the science
of the human heart, the fruit of the new
art, so far and so universally develop all
the resources of the imagination that in the
future the only romances written will be
"Various Facts?"</p>

<p>I have a firm belief that the triumph of
the Novel, the completest and most human
of all the works of art, will increase until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
the affinity and cohesion of all its parts
will be so perfect, that the process of its
creation will remain a mystery like the
development of human passions; I have
a firm belief that the harmony of its forms
will be so absolute, the sincerity of its
reality so evident, its method and justification
so deeply rooted, that the artist's hand
will remain absolutely invisible.</p>

<p>Then the romance will seem to portray
a real event, and the work of art will apparently
have come about by itself, spontaneously
springing into being and maturing
like a natural fact, without any point
of contact with its author. It will not have
preserved in its living form any stamp of
the mind in which it originated, any shade
of the eye that beheld it, any trace of the
lips that murmured the first words thereof
as the creative fiat; it will exist by its own
reason, by the mere fact that it is as it
should be and must be, palpitating with
life and as immutable as a statue of
bronze, the author of which has had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
divine courage of eclipsing himself and
disappearing in his immortal work.</p>

<p class="p2">A few years ago, down by the Simeto,
they were giving chase to a brigand, a
certain Gramigna,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> if I am not mistaken, a
name as cursed as the weed that bears it.
The man had left behind him, from one
end of the province to the other, the terror
of his evil reputation. Carabineers, <i>compagni
d'armi</i>, and cavalry-men had been
on his track for two months, without ever
succeeding in putting their claws on him;
he was alone, but was equal to ten, and the
evil plant threatened to take firm root.</p>

<p>Moreover the harvest-time was approaching,
the crops already covered the fields,
the ears bent over and were calling to the
reapers, who indeed had their reaping-hooks
in their hands, and yet not a single
proprietor dared show his nose over the
hedge of his estate, for fear of meeting
Gramigna, who might be stretched out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
among the furrows with his carbine between
his legs, ready to blow off the head
of the first person who should venture to
meddle with his affairs.</p>

<p>Thus the complaints were general.
Then the prefect summoned all those
gentlemen of the district&mdash;carabineers
and companies of armed men and told
them two words of the kind that makes
men prick up their ears. The next day
an earthquake in every nook and corner:&mdash;patrols,
squadrons, scouts for every
ditch and behind every wall; they hunted
him by day, by night, on foot, on horseback,
by telegraph, as if he had been a
wild beast! Gramigna eluded them every
time, and replied with shots if they came
too close on his track.</p>

<p>In the fields, in the villages, among the
factories, under the signs of country taverns,
wherever people met, Gramigna was
the only topic of conversation,&mdash;that wild
chase, that desperate flight. The carabineers'
horses returned dead-tired; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
soldiers threw themselves down in utter
weariness on the ground when they got
back to the stables; the patrols slept
wherever chance offered; Gramigna alone
was never tired, never slept, kept always
on the wing, climbed down precipices,
slipped through the harvest-fields, crept
on all fours among the prickly pear-trees,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
made his way out of danger like
a wolf by means of the hidden channels
of the torrents.</p>

<p>The chief argument of every discourse
at the cross roads, before the village entrances,
was the devouring thirst from
which the fugitive must suffer in the
immense, barren plain, under the June
sun. The lazy loungers opened wide their
eyes.</p>

<p>Peppa, one of the prettiest girls of
Licodia, was expecting at that time soon
to marry <i>compare</i> Finu, called "<i>Candela
di sego</i>" (the tallow-candle), who had
landed property and a bay mule, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
a tall young man, handsome as the sun,
who carried the standard of Santa Margherita
without bending his back, as
though he were a pillar.</p>

<p>Peppa's mother shed tears of delight
over the good fortune that had befallen
her daughter, and spent her time in looking
over and over the bride's effects in the
trunk, all white linen and of the nicest
quality, like a queen's, and earrings that
would hang down to the shoulders and
gold rings for all the ten fingers of both
hands; more money than Santa Margherita
could have ever had&mdash;and so they
were to have been married on Santa
Margherita's day, which would fall in June,
after the hay had been harvested.</p>

<p>"Candela di Sego," on his way back
from the field, used every evening to
leave his mule at Peppa's front door and
go in to tell how the crops promised to
be a veritable enchantment, unless Gramigna
set them on fire, and the lattice over
against the bed would not be large enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
to hold all the grain, and that it seemed to
him a thousand years off before he should
carry home his bride on the crupper of his
bay mule.</p>

<p>But Peppa one fine day said to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let your mule have a rest, for I do not
wish to get married."</p>

<p>The poor "Candela di Sego" was dumbfounded,
and the old mother began to
tear her hair when she heard that her
daughter had refused the best match in
the village.</p>

<p>"I am in love with Gramigna," said the
girl, "and he is the only one whom I will
marry."</p>

<p>"Ah!" screamed the mamma, and she
stormed through the house, with her gray
hair streaming so that she looked like a
witch&mdash;"Ah! that demon has been here
to bewitch my daughter!"</p>

<p>"No," replied Peppa, with her eyes
flashing like a sword&mdash;"no, he has not
been here."</p>

<p>"Where did you ever see him?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>"I never saw him. I have only heard
him spoken of. But I feel something
here, that burns me."</p>

<p>The report spread through the region,
though they tried to keep it a secret.
The women and girls who had envied
Peppa the prosperous farming, the bay
mule and the handsome youth who could
bear the standard of Santa Margherita
without bending his back, went around
telling all sorts of unkind stories: how
Gramigna had been to visit her one night
in the kitchen, and how he had been seen
hiding under the bed. The poor mother
burnt a lamp for the souls in purgatory
and even the curato went to Peppa's house
to touch her heart with his stole, so as to
drive out that devil of a Gramigna, who
had got possession of it.</p>

<p>But she persisted in her statement that
she did not know the fellow by sight;
but that she had seen him one night in a
dream, and the following morning she had
got up with her lips dry as if she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
herself suffered from all the thirst which
they reported him to be enduring.</p>

<p>Then the old woman shut her up in the
house, so that she might not hear another
word about Gramigna, and she stopped up
all the cracks of the door with images of
the saints.</p>

<p>Peppa heard all that was said in the
street behind the sacred images, and she
turned red and white, as if the devil had
kindled all his fires in her face.</p>

<p>Finally she heard it said that Gramigna
had been located among the prickly pear-trees
of Palagonia.</p>

<p>"They have been firing for two hours,"
they said. "He has killed one carabineer
and wounded more than three <i>compagni
d'armi</i>. But they sent back such a hailstorm
of shots that he must have been hit;
there was a pool of blood where he had
been."</p>

<p>Then Peppa made the sign of the cross
before the old mother's pillow, and made
her escape out of the window.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p>Gramigna was in the prickly pear-trees of
Palagonia, and they were not able to find him
in that stronghold of rabbits. He was ragged
and covered with blood, pale after two
days of fasting, burning with fever, and he
had his carbine levelled. When he saw her
coming, resolute, among the prickly pear
bushes, in the dim light of the gloaming, he
hesitated a moment whether to shoot or
not:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he demanded.
"What are you coming here for?"</p>

<p>"I am coming to stay with you," said
she, looking straight at him. "Are you
Gramigna?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am Gramigna. If you expect to
get those twenty <i>oncie</i><a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of reward, you are
mightily mistaken."</p>

<p>"No, I have come to stay with you,"
she replied.</p>

<p>"Go away!" said he. "You can't stay
with me, and I don't want anyone with me.
If you are after money, I tell you you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
made a mistake. I haven't any, mind
you! For two days I haven't had even a
morsel of bread."</p>

<p>"I can't go back home now," said she;
"the place is all full of soldiers."</p>

<p>"Go away! What is that to me? Each
for himself."</p>

<p>As she was turning away like a kicked
dog, Gramigna called to her:</p>

<p>"Say, go and get me a jug of water,
down yonder in the brook. If you want
to stay with me, you must risk your skin."</p>

<p>Peppa went without saying a word, and
when Gramigna heard the gunshots he
began to laugh immoderately, and said to
himself: "That was meant for me!"</p>

<p>But when he saw her coming back a few
minutes later with the jug in her hand,
pale and bleeding, he said, before he
sprang forward to snatch the jug from
her, and then when he had drunk till it
seemed as if he had no more breath:</p>

<p>"You escaped, did you? How did you
do it?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p>"The soldiers were on the other side,
and there was a thick bush on this."</p>

<p>"But they put a bullet through your
skin. There's blood on your dress."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where were you hit?"</p>

<p>"In the shoulder."</p>

<p>"That's nothing. You can walk."</p>

<p>So he allowed her to stay with him.
She followed him, all in rags, shoeless,
suffering from the fever caused by the
wound, and yet she went foraging to
procure for him a jug of water or a piece
of bread, and if she came back with empty
hands, escaping through the gunshots, her
lover, devoured by hunger and thirst,
would beat her. At last one night when
the moon was shining in the prickly pears,
Gramigna said to her,&mdash;</p>

<p>"They are on us."</p>

<p>And he obliged her to stand with her
back to the rock far in the crevice; then
he fled in another direction. Among the
bushes were heard the frequent reports of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
the musketry, and the shadows were cut
here and there by quick bright flashes.
Suddenly Peppa heard the sound of steps
near her and saw Gramigna coming back,
dragging along a broken leg. He leaned
against the prickly pear bushes to reload
his carbine:</p>

<p>"It's all over," he said to her. "Now
they'll take me."</p>

<p>And what froze the blood in her veins
more than anything else was the light that
shone in his eyes, as if he were a madman.</p>

<p>Then when he fell on the dry branches
like a log of wood, the soldiers were on
him in an instant.</p>

<p>The following day they dragged him
through the village street on a cart, all in
rags and covered with blood. The people
who had crowded in to look at him began
to laugh when they saw how small he was,
how pale and ugly like a punchinello.
And it was for him that Peppa had deserted
<i>compare</i> Finu, the "Candela di
Sego!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>The poor "Candela di Sego" went and
hid from sight, as if it behoved him to be
ashamed, and Peppa was led off, handcuffed
by soldiers, as if she also were a
thief,&mdash;she who had as much gold as
Santa Margherita! Her poor mother was
obliged to sell all the white linen stored in
her trunk, and the gold earrings and the
rings for the ten fingers, so as to pay the
lawyers who defended her daughter and
bring the girl home again,&mdash;poor, ill, in
shame, ugly as Gramigna, and with Gramigna's
child in her arms.</p>

<p>But when at the end of the trial her
daughter was restored to her, the poor old
soul recited an "Ave Maria" in the bare
and already dark jail among the soldiers
of the guard; it seemed to her that they
had given her back a treasure when she
had nothing else in the world, and she
wept like a fountain at this consolation.</p>

<p>Peppa on the other hand seemed to
have no tears to shed any more, and said
nothing, and disappeared from sight; yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the two women went out every day to get
their living by their own hands. People
declared that Peppa had taken up "the
trade" in the woods, and went on robbing
expeditions at night. The truth of the
matter was that she hid herself in the
kitchen like a wild beast in its lair, and it
was only when her old mother was dead of
her privations, and the house had to be
sold, that she left it.</p>

<p>"See here!" said "Candela di Sego,"
who was as much in love with her as ever,
"I could smash your head with two stones
for the evil you have brought on yourself
and others."</p>

<p>"It's true," replied Peppa, "I know it.
It was God's will."</p>

<p>After her house and those few wretched
pieces of furniture that were left to her
were sold, she went away from the town
by night, just as she had done before,
without turning round to look at the roof
under which she had slept so long, and
she went to do God's will in the city, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
her baby boy, near the prison in which
Gramigna was incarcerated. She could
see nothing else besides the black grated
windows along the mighty silent façade,
and the sentinels drove her away if she
stopped to look where he might be. At
last she was told that he had not been
there for some time, that he had been
taken away to the other side of the sea,
manacled, and with a basket fastened over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>She said nothing. She did not go
away; for she knew not where to go, and
she had nothing more to expect. She
made a shift to live, doing chores for the
soldiers, for the prisoners, as if she herself
made a part of that black and silent building;
and she felt for the carabineers who
had taken Gramigna in the thicket of
prickly pears, and who had broken his
leg with their shots, a sort of respectful
tenderness, as it were a brute admiration
of force.</p>

<p>On holidays, when she saw them with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
their plumes and their glittering epaulettes,
stiff and erect in their gala uniforms, she
devoured them with her eyes, and she was
always at the barracks cleaning the big
rooms and polishing the boots, so that they
called her "The Carabineers' dish-cloth."</p>

<p>Only when she saw them load their guns
at nightfall and march out, two and two,
with their trousers turned up, revolver in
belt, and when they mounted horse under
the light that made the muskets flash, and
heard the clattering of the horses' feet
dying away in the darkness and the jingling
of sabres, she always grew pale, and
while she was closing the door of the
stable she shivered; and when her youngster
played with the other urchins on the
glacis before the prison, running among
the legs of the soldiers, and the urchins
called him "Gramigna's son, Gramigna's
son," she flew into a rage and chased them
away with stones.</p>

<h2 class="p6">JELI, THE SHEPHERD.</h2>

<p class="center p6"><span class="b1">JELI, THE SHEPHERD.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">J</span>eli, who had charge of the horses, was
thirteen when he first became acquainted
with the young gentleman, Don
Alfonso. But he was so small that he did
not come up to the belly of the old mare
Bianca, who carried the big bell for the
drove. Wherever his animals wandered
for their pasturage, here and there, on the
mountains and down in the plain, he was
always to be found erect and motionless on
some eminence or squatting on some big
rock.</p>

<p>His friend, Don Alfonso, while he was
at his country seat, went to find him all
the days that God sent to Tebidi, and
shared with him his piece of chocolate
and shepherd's barley-bread and the fruit
stolen in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>At first Jeli called the young nobleman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
<i>eccellenza</i>&mdash;your excellence&mdash;as is the custom
in Sicily, but after they had had one
good quarrel their friendship was established
on a solid basis. Jeli taught his
friend how to climb up to the magpies'
nests on the tip-top of the walnut-trees,
higher than the campanile of Licodia, to
knock down a sparrow on the wing with a
stone, and to mount with one spring on the
bare backs of his half-wild animals, seizing
by the mane the first that came within
reach, without being frightened by the
wrathful whinnyings and the desperate
leaps of the untrained colts.</p>

<p>Ah! the delightful gallops across the
mown fields with their hair flying in the
wind; the lovely April days when the wind
billowed the green grass and the horses
neighed in the pastures; the glorious
summer noons when the whitening fields
lay silent under the cloudy sky, and the
crickets crackled among the clods as
though the stubble were on fire; the
bright wintry sky seen through the naked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
branches of the almond trees shivering
under the north wind, and the narrow
path sounding frozen under the horses'
hoofs, and the larks singing on high in
the warmth, in the azure; the delicious
summer afternoons that passed slowly,
slowly, like the clouds; the sweet odor of
the hay in which they plunged their elbows,
and the melancholy humming of the
evening insects, and those two notes of
Jeli's zufolo or whistle, always the same&mdash;iuh
iuh!&mdash;making one think of distant
things, of the feast of Saint John, of
Christmas eve, of the dawn of the <i>scampagnata</i>,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
of all those great events of the
past which seemed sad, so distant were
they, and made you look up with moistened
eyes as if all the stars that were
kindling in heaven poured showers into
your heart and made it overflow!</p>

<p>Jeli, himself, did not suffer from any
such melancholy; he squatted on the side
of the hill with puffed-out cheeks, quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
intent on sounding his iuh! iuh! iuh!
Then he would bring together his drove
by dint of shouts and stones, and drive
them into the stable beyond the "poggio
alla Croce."<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Out of breath he would mount the hillside
beyond the valley, and sometimes
shout to his friend Alfonso,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Call the dog! ohè! Call the dog!"
or "Fling a good-sized stone at the bay
who's got the better of me and is slowly
wandering away, dallying among the
bushes of the valley," or "To-morrow
bring me a big needle&mdash;one of <i>gnà</i> Lia's."</p>

<p>He could do all sorts of things with the
needle, and he had a heap of odds and
ends in his canvas bag, in case of need, to
mend his trousers or the sleeves of his
jacket; he also knew how to braid horsehairs,
and with the clay in the valley he
used to wash out his own handkerchief
which he wore around his neck when it
was cold. In fact, provided he had his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
bag with him, he needed nothing in the
world, whether he were in the woods of
Resecone, or lost in the depths of the plain
of Caltagirone. <i>Gnà</i> Lia used to say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you see Jeli, the shepherd? He is
always alone in the fields, as if he himself
had been born a colt, and that's why he
knows how to make the cross with his two
hands!"<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, it is true that Jeli needed nothing,
but everybody connected with the estate
would have gladly helped him in any way
because he was a serviceable lad, and there
was always a chance of getting something
from him. <i>Gnà</i> Lia baked bread for him
out of neighborly love, and he showed his
gratitude by making her osier baskets for
her eggs, reels of reeds, and other little
things.</p>

<p>"Let us do as his animals do," said <i>gnà</i>
Lia, "they scratch each other's backs."</p>

<p>At Tebidi every one had known him
since he was a baby; there was no time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
when he wasn't seen among the tails of
the horses pasturing in the "field of the
<i>lettighiere</i>" and he had grown up, so to
speak, under their eyes, though really no
one ever saw him very much, for he was
forever here and there, roaming about with
his drove.</p>

<p>"He had rained down from heaven and
the earth had taken him up," as the proverb
has it; he was just one of those who have
neither home nor relatives. His <i>mamma</i>
was out at service at Vizzini, and he never
saw her more than once a year when he
went with his colts to the fair of San Giovanni;
and the day that she died they came
to call him&mdash;it was one Saturday evening&mdash;and
on the following Monday Jeli was
back with his drove, so that the <i>contadino</i>
who had taken his place in looking after
the horses might not lose a day's work;
but the poor lad came back so upset that
he kept letting the colts get into the
ploughed land.</p>

<p>"Ohè! Jeli!" cried <i>massaro</i> Agrippino,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
from the threshing-floor. "You want to
have a taste of the rope's end, do you, you
son of a dog?"</p>

<p>Jeli started to run after his stray colts,
and drove them mechanically toward the
hill; but always before his eyes he saw his
mamma with her head done up in the white
handkerchief. She would never speak to
him more!</p>

<p>His father was a cow-herd at Ragoleti,
beyond Licodia, "where the malaria could
be harvested," as the peasants of that
region say, meaning to signify its density;
but in the malarious lands the pasturage is
fat and cows do not catch the fever. Jeli
for that reason stayed in the fields all the
year long, either at Don Ferrante's, or in
the enclosure of la Commenda, or in the
valley of il Jacitano, and the hunters or
travellers who took cross-cut over the country
saw him in this place or in that, like a
dog without a master.</p>

<p>He did not suffer from this state of things
because he was accustomed to be with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
horses, as they moved about leisurely nibbling
the clover, and with the birds who
flew around him in bevies, while the sun
accomplished his daily journey, slowly,
slowly, until the shadows grew long and
then vanished; he had time to watch the
clouds pile up on the horizon, one behind
another, and imagine them mountains and
valleys; he knew how the wind blew when
it brought thunder-showers, and what color
the clouds were when it was going to snow.
Everything had its aspect and significance,
and his eyes and ears were kept on the
alert all day long. In the same way when
toward sunset the young herdsman began
to play his alder-whistle, the brown mare
would come up, lazily cropping the clover,
and also stand looking with great, pensive
eyes.</p>

<p>The only place where he suffered a little
from melancholy was in the desert lands of
Passanitello, where not a grass-blade or a
shrub is to be seen, and during the hot
months not a bird flies. The horses there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
would cluster together with drooping heads
to shade one another, and during the long
days of the threshing that mighty silent
radiance rained down without mitigation
for sixteen hours. Wherever pasturage
was abundant and the horses liked to loiter,
the lad busied himself with something
else&mdash;he would make reed-cages for the
crickets, or carved pipes and little baskets
of bulrushes; with four branches he could
set up a shelter for himself when the North
wind drove the long lines of crows through
the valley, or, when the cicadæ fluttered
their wings in the broiling sun over the
parched stubble; he would roast acorns in
the coals of his sumach fire and imagine
they were chestnuts, or toast his thick slice
of bread when it began to grow musty, because,
when he was at Passanitello in winter,
the roads were so bad that sometimes a
fortnight would elapse without a single
soul passing.</p>

<p>Don Alfonso, who had been kept in cotton
by his parents, envied his friend Jeli
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
the canvas bag in which he stored his
effects,&mdash;his bread, his onions, his bottle
of wine, his neckerchief for cold weather,
his little hoard of rags and thread and
needles, his little tin food-box and his flint;
he envied him especially that superb spotted
mare, that animal with rough forelock and
wicked eyes, swelling her indignant nostrils
like a fierce mastiff when anyone tried to
mount her. Sometimes she would allow
Jeli to get on her back and scratch her
ears; she was jealous of him, and would
come smelling round to find out what he
was saying.</p>

<p>"Let the <i>vajata</i> be," Jeli would say,
"She isn't ugly, but she doesn't know
you."</p>

<p>After Scordu from Bucchiere took away
the Calabrian which he had bought at San
Giovanni's Fair, under agreement to keep
her in the drove until vintage time, <i>Zaino</i>,
the bay colt, orphaned, refused to be comforted
and galloped over the mountain
precipices with long, lamenting neighings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
and its nose in the wind. Jeli ran behind
it, calling to it with loud shouts, and the
colt paused to listen with its head in the
air, and its ears pricking back and forth,
and switching its flanks with its tail.</p>

<p>"It's because they have carried off his
mother, and he doesn't know what to make
of it," observed the herdsman. "Now we
must keep him in sight, for he would be
capable of jumping over the precipice.
That was the way I felt when my mamma
died; I couldn't see with my eyes."</p>

<p>Then, after the colt began to try the
clover and to make believe bite:&mdash;</p>

<p>"See! he is gradually beginning to forget....
But this one will be sold, too.
Horses are made to be sold, just as lambs
are born to go to the butcher, and the
clouds to bring the rain. Only the birds
have nothing else to do but sing and fly all
day."</p>

<p>These ideas did not come to him clear
cut and in sequence one after the other,
for it was rarely that he had anyone to talk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
with, and, therefore, he had no cause for
haste in starting them up and disentangling
them in the depths of his brain, where he
was accustomed to let them sprout and
grow gradually, as the twigs burgeon under
the sun.</p>

<p>"Even the birds," he added, "have to
hunt for food, and when the snow covers
the ground they perish."</p>

<p>Then he pondered for a moment,&mdash;"You
are like the birds; but when winter comes
you can sit by the fire and do nothing."</p>

<p>But Don Alfonso replied that he too
went to school and had to study. Jeli
opened his eyes wide and was all ears,
while the signorino began to read, and he
looked at the book and at the young master
himself with a suspicious air, listening with
that slight winking of the eyelids which
indicates intensity of attention in beasts
little accustomed to mankind.</p>

<p>He was delighted with the poetry that
caressed his ears with the harmony of an
incomprehensible song, and occasionally he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
frowned, drew up his chin, and made it evident
that a great mental operation was taking
place within him; then he nodded "yes,
yes," with a crafty smile, and scratched
his head. Then when the signorino started
to write so as to show how many things
he knew how to do, Jeli could have staid
whole days watching him; and suddenly he
would look round suspiciously. He could
not be persuaded that the words that were
said either by him or by Don Alfonso could
possibly be repeated on paper, and still
more&mdash;those things that had not proceeded
from their mouths, and he ended with that
shrewd smile.</p>

<p>Every new idea which knocked for entrance
at his head made him suspicious; he
seemed to try it with the wild diffidence of
his <i>vajata</i>. But he expressed no wonder at
anything in the world; he might have been
told that in cities horses rode in carriages,&mdash;he
would have kept on that mask of
oriental indifference which is the dignity of
a Sicilian peasant. It would seem as if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
intrenched himself instinctively in his ignorance,
as if it were the force of poverty.
Every time that he remained short of arguments
he would repeat,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not know at all. I am poor," with
that obstinate smile that was intended to
be shrewd.</p>

<p>He had asked his friend Alfonso to
write for him the name of Mara on a piece
of paper that he had found somewhere, because
it was his habit to pick up whatever
he saw lying about and put into his packet
of odds and ends. One day, after being
rather quiet and looking round anxiously,
he said, very gravely,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm in love with some one."</p>

<p>Alfonso, though he knew how to read,
opened his eyes in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued Jeli, "<i>massaro</i> Agrippino's
daughter Mara, who used to be here;
but now they're at Marineo, in that great
house in the plain that you can see from
the 'plain of the <i>lettighiere</i>' yonder."</p>

<p>"O you're going to get married, then?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, when I'm grown up and have six
<i>onze</i> a year wages. Mara knows nothing
about it."</p>

<p>"Why, haven't you told her?"</p>

<p>Jeli shook his head and reflected. Then
he opened his hoard and unfolded the
paper which bore the written name.</p>

<p>"It must be that it says 'Mara'; Don
Gesualdo, the <i>campiere</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> has read it; and
<i>fra</i> Cola, when he came down here begging
for beans."</p>

<p>"He who knows how to write," he went
on saying, "is like one who preserves words
in his tinder-box and can carry them in his
pocket, and even send them this way and
that."</p>

<p>"Now what are you going to do with
that piece of paper that you can't read?"
asked Alfonso.</p>

<p>Jeli shrugged his shoulders, but kept on
carefully folding his written leaf to put
away in his heap of odds and ends.</p>

<p>He had known la Mara ever since she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
was a little girl. Their acquaintance had
begun in a pitched battle once when they
met down in the valley, both of them after
blackberries. The little girl, knowing that
she was "within her rights," had seized
Jeli by the neck as if he were a thief.
For awhile they exchanged blows on the
slope&mdash;"You one, I one,"&mdash;as the cooper
does on the hoops of his barrels; but when
they got tired of it they gradually calmed
down, though they still had each other by
the hair.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Mara.</p>

<p>And when Jeli with less breeding refused
to tell who he was,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am Mara, the daughter of <i>Massaro</i>
Agrippino, who is the keeper of all these
fields here."</p>

<p>Jeli then let his grasp relax, and the
little girl set to work to pick up the blackberries
that had fallen during their struggle,
now and then glancing with curiosity
at her antagonist.</p>

<p>"Just beyond the bridge, on the edge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
the orchard, there are lots of big berries,"
suggested the little maid, "and the hens
are eating them."</p>

<p>Jeli meantime was creeping off stealthily,
and Mara, after standing on tip-toe to
watch him disappearing in the grove,
turned her back and ran home as fast as
her legs would carry her.</p>

<p>But from that day forth they began to
be friends. Mara went with her hemp to
spin on to the parapet of the little bridge,
and Jeli would slowly drive his cattle
toward the slopes of the <i>poggio del Bandito</i>.
At first he kept at a distance, roving
around and looking from afar, with suspicion
in his face, but he kept gradually
edging near, with the watchful gait of a
dog used to stones. When at last he
joined her, they remained long hours without
speaking a word, Jeli attentively watching
the intricate work of the stockings
which Mara's mamma had hung round her
neck, or she looking on while he carved
his pretty zig-zags on the almond sticks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Then they would separate, he going one
way, she the other, without saying a word,
and the little girl as soon as she was in
sight of her house would start to run, kicking
high her petticoat with her little red
legs.</p>

<p>When the prickly pears were ripe they
would settle down in the thick of the bushes,
peeling the figs all the live-long day. They
would wander together under the immemorial
walnuts, and Jeli would beat so
many of the walnuts that they would
shower down thick as hail, and the girl
would tire herself out picking them up with
jubilant shouts&mdash;more than she could
carry; and then she would scamper away
nimbly, holding up the two corners of her
apron, bobbing like a little old woman.</p>

<p>During the winter time, Mara dared not
put her nose out of doors, it was so cold.
Sometimes toward evening could be seen
the smoke of Jeli's fires of sumach wood,
which he built on the <i>Piano del lettighiere</i>, or
on the <i>Poggio di Macca</i>, so as not to perish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
of the cold, like the tomtits which he sometimes
found in the morning behind some
rock, or in the shelter of a clod. The
horses also found pleasure in dangling
their tails around the fire, and they would
cuddle close together so as to be warmer.</p>

<p>In March, the larks came back to the
plain, the sparrows to the roofs, the leaves
and the nests to the hedges. Mara took
up her habit of going about with Jeli in
the soft grass among the flowering bushes
under the still bare trees which were just
beginning to show tender points of green.
Jeli would make his way through the
brambles like a bloodhound, so as to discover
the nests of the blackbirds which
would look up to him in astonishment with
their little keen eyes; the two children
would carry, cuddled in their hearts, little
wee rabbits just born, almost without fur,
but already quick to move their long ears.</p>

<p>They would scour the fields in pursuit
of the drove of horses, entering the plains
behind the hay-gatherers, step for step
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
with the herd, pausing every time that a
mare stopped to pluck a mouthful of grass.
At evening, when they got back to the
bridge, they separated, he going in one
direction, she in another, without saying
good-by.</p>

<p>Thus they passed the whole summer.
When the sun began to go down behind
the <i>Poggio alla Croce</i>, the robin red-breasts
also went toward the mountain, as it grew
dark, following the light among the clumps
of prickly pears. The crickets and cicadæ
were no longer heard, and at that hour a
great melancholy spread through the air.</p>

<p>About that time, to Jeli's tumble-down
hovel came his father, the cowherd, who
had caught the malaria at Ragoleti, and
could scarcely dismount from the ass which
brought him. Jeli started a fire quickly,
and ran to "the hall" for some hen's eggs.</p>

<p>"Put a little straw down in front of the
fire as soon as you can," said his father,
"for I feel the fever returning."</p>

<p>The chill of the fever was so severe that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
<i>compare</i> Menu buried under his thick
cloak, the saddle-bags of the ass and Jeli's
sacks shook as the leaves do in November,
in spite of the great blaze of branches
which made his face white as a corpse.</p>

<p>The contadini of the farm came to ask
him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How do you think you feel, <i>compare</i>
Menu?"</p>

<p>The poor man could only answer with
a whine like a sucking puppy.</p>

<p>"It's a kind of malaria that kills more
surely than a rifle bullet," said his friends,
as they warmed their hands at the fire.</p>

<p>The doctor was called, but it was money
thrown away, because the disease is one of
those clear and evident ones which even a
boy would know how to cure; unless the
fever happens to be so severe that it will
kill at any rate, a little quinine cures it
quickly.</p>

<p><i>Compare</i> Menu spent the eyes of his
head for quinine but it was as good as
thrown down a well.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>"Take a good dose of <i>ecalibbiso</i> tea,
which does not cost anything," suggested
<i>massaro</i> Agrippino, "and if it doesn't
work as well as quinine it doesn't ruin you
by its cost."</p>

<p>So he took the decoction of eucaliptus,
but the fever returned all the same, and
even more violently. Jeli attended to his
father the best he knew how. Every morning
before he went off with his colts, he left
him his medicine all prepared in a drinking
cup, his bundle of dry branches within
reach, his eggs in the hot ashes, and he
came back as early as he could in the
afternoon with more wood for the night,
and the bottle of wine and a little piece of
mutton, which he had gone as far as
Licodia to buy for him. The poor lad did
everything as handily as a clever maiden
would have done, and his father, following
him with weary eyes in his operations
about the hovel, sometimes smiled to think
that the boy would be able to do for himself
in case he were left alone in the world.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>On days when the fever left him for a
few hours, <i>compare</i> Menu would get up, all
feeble as he was, and with his head
wrapped in his handkerchief, would stagger
out to the door to wait for Jeli while the
sun was still warm. When Jeli dropped
the bundle of wood at the door-steps, and
placed the bottle and the eggs on the table,
he would say to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Put the <i>ecalibbiso</i> to boiling for to-night,"
or, "Remember that your aunt
Agata has charge of your mother's money,
when I shall be no more."</p>

<p>Jeli would nod "yes" with his head.</p>

<p>"It is hopeless," said <i>massaro</i> Agrippino,
every time he came to see <i>compare</i> Menu
and his fever. "His blood is all diseased
by this time."</p>

<p><i>Compare</i> Menu listened without winking,
with his face whiter than his night-cap.</p>

<p>He now no longer got up. Jeli began to
weep when he found himself not strong
enough to help him turn from one side to
the other; shortly after <i>compare</i> Menu lay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
perfectly still. The last words that he
spoke to his boy were,&mdash;</p>

<p>"When I am dead, go to the owner of
the cows at Ragoleti and let him give you
the three <i>onze</i> and the twelve <i>tumoli</i> of corn,
which are my due from March till now."</p>

<p>"No," replied Jeli, "it's only two <i>onze</i>
and a half, because you left the cows more
than a month ago, and one must be fair to
one's <i>padrone</i>."</p>

<p>"True!" agreed <i>compare</i> Menu, closing
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Now I am quite alone in the world,
like a lost colt which the wolves may eat!"
said Jeli to himself, when his father had
been carried off to the cemetery of Licodia.</p>

<p>Mara had been one of those who came
to see the dead man's house with that
morbid curiosity which is excited by horrible
things.</p>

<p>"Do you see how I am left?" asked
Jeli, but the girl drew back so frightened
that he could not induce her to step inside
the house where the dead man had been.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>Jeli went to receive the money due his
father, and then he started off with his
drove for Passanitello, where the grass was
already tall on the fallow-land, and the
fodder was abundant; therefore, the colts
remained there for some time in pasture.</p>

<p>Meantime Jeli had been growing into a
big lad, and Mara also must be grown tall,
he often thought to himself, while he played
on his <i>zufalo</i>; and when he returned to
Tebidi after some little time, slowly driving
forward the mares through the dangerous
paths of "Uncle Cosimo's Fountain,"
he scanned the little bridge down in
the valley, and the hovel in the <i>Valle del
Jacitano</i>, and the roof of "the Hall" where
the pigeons were always flying.</p>

<p>But at that time the <i>padrone</i> had dismissed
<i>massaro</i> Agrippino, and all Mara's
family were just on the point of moving
away.</p>

<p>Jeli found the girl, who had grown tall
and very pretty, standing at the entrance
of the yard watching the furniture and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
things, which they were loading on the cart.
The empty room seemed to him more
gloomy and smoky than ever before. The
table, the commode and the images of the
Virgin and of Saint John, and even the
nails for hanging up the gourds for seed
had left on the walls the marks where they
had been for so many years.</p>

<p>"We are going away," said Mara, when
she saw him looking around. "We are
going down to Marineo, where the great
house stands in the plain."</p>

<p>Jeli took hold and helped <i>massaro</i> Agrippino
and <i>la gnà Lia</i> load up the cart, and
when there was nothing else to carry out
of the room he went and sat down with
Mara on the edge of the watering-trough.</p>

<p>"Even houses," he remarked, when he
saw the last hamper piled on, "even houses,
when anything is taken away from them,
do not any longer seem the same."</p>

<p>"At Marineo," replied Mara, "we shall
have much better rooms, mamma says, and
large as the cheese house."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>"Now that you are going away, I shall
not want to come here any more; it seems
to me as if winter had come back&mdash;to see
that door closed."</p>

<p>"At Marineo we shall find other friends,
Pudda <i>la rossa</i> and the <i>campiere's</i> daughter;
it will be jolly there; they have more than
eighty harvesters in the season, and the
bag-pipes, and they dance on the threshing-floor."</p>

<p><i>Massaro</i> Agrippino and his wife had
gone off with the cart. Mara ran behind
them, full of joyous excitement, carrying
the baskets with the pigeons. Jeli was
going to accompany her as far as the little
bridge; and when Mara was just on the
point of disappearing down the valley he
called after her, "Mara! oh! Mara!"</p>

<p>"What do you want?" demanded Mara.</p>

<p>He knew not what he wanted.</p>

<p>"Oh! what will you do here all alone?"
asked the girl.</p>

<p>"I shall stay with the colts."</p>

<p>Mara ran skipping away, and he stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
there as if rooted to the spot so as to catch
the last sounds of the cart rattling over
the stones.</p>

<p>The sun was just resting on the high
rocks of the <i>Poggio alla Croce</i>, the gray
crests of the olive trees were shading into
the twilight and over the vast campagna
far away, nothing was heard except the
tinkling bell of "Bianca" in the gathering
stillness.</p>

<p>Mara, now that she was in the midst of
new faces and amid all the bustle of the
grape gathering, forgot about Jeli; but he
was always thinking about her, because he
had nothing else to do in the long days
that he spent looking at the horses' tails.
There was now no special reason for him to
go down into the valley beyond the bridge,
and no one ever saw him any more at the
farm.</p>

<p>Thus it was that he was for some time
ignorant that Mara had become betrothed&mdash;so
much water had run and run under
the bridge. The only time that he saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
the girl was on the day of Saint John's <i>Festa</i>,
when he went to the fair with his colts to
sell; a festa which changed everything for
him into poison, and caused the bread to
fall out of his mouth by reason of an accident
that befell one of the <i>padrone's</i> colts&mdash;the
Lord deliver us!</p>

<p>On the day of the fair, the factor waited
for the colts ever since dawn, walking impatiently
up and down in his well-polished
boots behind the groups of horses and
mules that came filing in along the highway
from this direction and that. It was almost
time for the fair to close, and still
Jeli with his animals was not in sight beyond
the turn made by the highway. On
the parched slopes of <i>Calvario</i> and the
<i>Mulino a vento</i>&mdash;the Wind-Mill Mountain&mdash;there
remained only a few droves of sheep
gathered in a circle, with noses drooping
and weary eyes, and a few yoke of oxen
with long hair&mdash;of the kind that are sold
to satisfy unpaid rent, waiting motionless
under the boiling sun.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p>Yonder toward the valley, the bell of
San Giovanni's was ringing for High
Mass, accompanied by the long crackling
of the fireworks.</p>

<p>Then the fair grounds seemed to spring
up, and there ran a prolonged cry among
the shops of the green grocers, clustered
in the place called <i>salita dei Galli</i>, spreading
through the country roads and seeming
to return from the valley where the church
stood.</p>

<p>"Viva San Giovanni!"</p>

<p>"<i>Santo diavolone!</i>" screamed the factor.
"That assassin of a Jeli will make me lose
the fair!"</p>

<p>The sheep lifted their heads in astonishment
and began to bleat all at once, and
the cattle also made a step or two, slowly
looking around with their great, calm eyes.</p>

<p>The factor was in a rage because he was
expected that day to pay the rent due for
the large enclosures&mdash;as the contract expressed
it, "when Saint John arrived under
the elm;" and to make up the full sum,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
the profits on the sale of the colts was necessary.
Meantime the colts and horses
and mules were coming in such numbers
as the good Lord had seen fit to make, all
curried and shining and adorned with tassels
and cockades and bells; and they
were switching their tails to while away
their tedium, and turning their heads
toward every one who passed, and evidently
waiting for some charitable soul
willing to buy them.</p>

<p>"He must have gone to sleep on the
way, the assassin!" yelled the factor, "and
so made me lose the sale of my colts."</p>

<p>In reality, Jeli had travelled all night so
that the colts might reach the fair fresh,
and get a good position on their arrival;
and he had reached the <i>piano del Corvo</i>,
and the "three kings" had not yet set,
but were shining over <i>monte Arturo</i>.
There was a continuous procession of
carts passing along the road, and people
mounted on horses or mules going to the
<i>festa</i>. Therefore, the young fellow kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
his eyes open so that the colts, frightened
by the unusual commotion, might not get
away, but that he might keep them together
along the ridge of the road behind
<i>la bianca</i>, the white mare, who with the
bell around her neck, always travelled
straight ahead without minding anything.</p>

<p>From time to time, when the road ran
over the crest of the hills, the bell of
Saint John's could be heard in the distance,
and in the darkness and silence of the
plain the rumor of the <i>festa</i> was distinguishable,
and along the whole road far
away, wherever there were people on foot
or on horseback going to Vizzini, were
heard shouts of "<i>Viva San Giovanni!</i>"
And the rockets rose up high in the air
and brilliant behind the mountains of la
Canzaria, like the rain of meteors in
August.</p>

<p>"It is like Christmas Eve!" Jeli kept
saying to the boy, who was helping him
drive the herd. "And in every place
there is feasting and light, and throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
the whole campagna you can see fireworks."</p>

<p>The boy was half asleep as he forced
one leg after the other, and he made no
response; but Jeli, who felt his blood stir
within him at the sound of that bell, could
not keep quiet, as if each one of those
rockets that left their silent shining trails
on the darkness behind the mountains
burst forth from his soul.</p>

<p>"Mara also must be going to the <i>festa</i>
of Saint John," he said, "because she goes
every year."</p>

<p>And without caring because the boy
made no reply,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't you know? Mara is now so big
that she must be taller than her mother,
and when I saw her last I couldn't believe
that it was the very same girl with whom I
used to go after prickly pears and knock
off the nuts."</p>

<p>And he began to sing at the top of his
voice all the songs that he knew.</p>

<p>"Oh Alfio, why do you sleep?" he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
cried, when he was through with them.
"Look out that you keep <i>la bianca</i> always
behind you, look out!"</p>

<p>"No, I am not asleep," replied Alfio,
with a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>"Do you see <i>la puddara</i><a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> which stands
winking down at us yonder, as if they were
firing up rockets also at Santa Domenica?
It is almost sunrise; we shall reach the
fair in time to secure a good position. Ah!
<i>morellino bello</i>! you pretty little brownie!
You shall have a new halter, that you
shall, with red cockades for the fair; and
so shall you, <i>stellato</i>!"<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Thus he went on, talking to one and
another of his colts so that they might be
encouraged hearing his voice in the darkness.
But it grieved him to think that
the <i>stellato</i> and the <i>morellino</i> were going to
the fair to be sold.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>"When they are sold, they'll go off with
a new master, and we shan't see them any
more in the herd, just as it was with Mara
after she went to Marineo.</p>

<p>"Her father is well-to-do down there at
Marineo, and when I was there, found
myself, poor fellow that I was, sitting down
to bread and wine and cheese, and everything
good that God gives, and as if he
were the factor himself, and he has the
keys to everything, and I could eat up
the whole place if I had wanted. Mara
scarcely knew me, it had been so long
since we had seen each other, and she
cried out,&mdash;'Oh, look! there's Jeli the
guardian of the horses, from Tebidi. He
is like one who comes home from abroad,
who only at the sight of the distant mountain-top
is quick enough to recognize the
country where he grew up.' <i>Gnà</i> Lia
didn't want me to speak to her daughter
with the <i>thee</i> and the <i>thou</i>, because Mara
had grown to be so big, and the people
who don't know about things easily gossip.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
But Mara only laughed, and looked
as if she had only just that minute been
baking the bread, so rosy her face was; she
was getting the dinner ready, and she was
unfolding the table-cloth, and she seemed
different. 'Oh, have you forgotten Tebidi?'
I asked her as soon as <i>gnà</i> Lia went out
to broach a fresh cask of wine. 'No, no,
I haven't forgotten' said she. 'At Tebidi
there was a bell with a campanile looking
like the handle of a salt-cellar, and there
used to be two stone cats which stood at
the entrance of the garden.' I felt all
through me those things that she was saying.
Mara looked at me from head to
heels, with her eyes wide open, and then
she said,&mdash;'How tall you've grown!' and
then she began to laugh, and then she
patted me on the head&mdash;here!"</p>

<p>In this way Jeli, the guardian of the
horses, came to lose his place; for just at
that instant there suddenly appeared a
coach, which had given no sign of its approach,
because it had been slowly climbing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
the steep ascent, but started off at full
speed as soon as it reached the level ground
at the top, with a great cracking of whips
and jingling of bells, as if it were carried
by the devil himself. The colts, in alarm,
galloped off quicker than a flash, as if there
had been an earthquake, and all the shouts
and cries and <i>ohi! ohi! ohi's!</i> of Jeli and
the boy scarcely sufficed to collect them
again around <i>la bianca</i>, who in spite of her
gravity had shied away desperately with
the bell around her neck.</p>

<p>When Jeli had counted over his animals
he discovered that <i>stellato</i> was missing, and
he buried his hands in his hair, because at
that place the road ran along side a deep
ravine, and it was down in that ravine that
<i>stellato</i> broke his back&mdash;a colt worth a
dozen <i>onze</i>, like a dozen angels from Paradise!
Weeping and shouting he went
calling the colt <i>ahu! ahu!</i> It was too dark
to see it. At last <i>stellato</i> replied from the
bottom of the ravine with a melancholy
neigh, as if it had human speech, poor
creature!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, mamma mia!" cried Jeli and the
boy, as they went to it. "Oh, what bad
luck! mamma mia!"</p>

<p>The travellers on their way to the <i>festa</i>,
hearing such a lamentation in the darkness,
asked what they had lost, and then
when they learned what had happened,
went on their way.</p>

<p>The <i>stellato</i> remained motionless where
it had fallen, with its legs in the air, and
while Jeli was feeling it all over, weeping
and talking to it as if he could make it
understand, the poor creature stretched
out its neck painfully and turned its head
toward him, and then could be heard its
breathing, cut short by its agony.</p>

<p>"Something must be broken!" mourned
Jeli in despair, because nothing could be
seen in the darkness; and the colt, inert as
a rock, let its head fall back. Alfio, who
remained on the road above in charge of
the drove, had begun to view the matter
more calmly, and had taken out his bread
from his bag.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>The sky by this time was beginning to
grow pale, and the mountains all around
seemed to be blossoming out, one after
another, dark and high. From the bend
in the road the country round about began
to stand out, with <i>monte del Calvario</i> and
<i>monte del Mulino a vento</i>&mdash;the Windmill
Mountain&mdash;outlined against the dawn.
They were still in shadow, but the flocks of
sheep made white blurs, and as the herds
of cattle grazing along the ridge of the
mountains wandered hither and thither
against the azure sky, it seemed as if the
profile of the mountain itself were alive
and full of motion.</p>

<p>The bell from the depths of the valley
was no longer heard; travellers were growing
less numerous, and those who passed
along were in haste to reach the fair.
Poor Jeli knew not what saint to call on in
that solitude. Alfio himself could not help
him in any way; so the boy continued
breaking off the morsels of his loaf leisurely.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>At last the factor was seen coming along
mounted, cursing and swearing as he
came, at seeing his animals stopped on
the road. When Alfio saw him he ran off
down the hill. But Jeli did not stir from
the side of the <i>stellato</i>. The factor left his
mule by the roadside, and climbed down
into the ravine. He tried to help the colt
to rise; he pulled him by the tail.</p>

<p>"Let him be," said Jeli, as white in the
face as if it were himself whose back was
broken. "Let him be! Don't you see
that he can't move, poor creature."</p>

<p>The <i>stellato</i>, in fact, at every movement
and at every attempt made to help him,
set up a screech that seemed human. The
factor fell on Jeli tooth and nail, and gave
him as many kicks as there are angels and
saints in Paradise. By this time Alfio had
got his courage back, and had returned to
the road, so that the animals might not be
without a guardian, and he tried to excuse
himself, saying, "'T wasn't my fault. I
was on ahead with the <i>bianca</i>."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>"There's nothing more to be done,"
said the factor at last, having persuaded
himself that it was all time lost. "Nothing
can be done with this colt but to take
his pelt; that's good for something."</p>

<p>Jeli began to tremble like a leaf when he
saw the factor go and fetch his gun from
the mule's pack.</p>

<p>"Get off of him, good-for-nothing!"
shouted the factor. "I don't know what
keeps me from laying you out beside this
colt, which is worth more than you, in
spite of the swine's baptism which that
thief of a priest gave you!"</p>

<p>The <i>stellato</i>, unable to move, turned its
head, with its big, steady eyes, as if it
understood every word, and its skin crisped
in waves along the back-bone as if a chill
ran over it.</p>

<p>In that way, the factor killed the <i>stellato</i>
on the spot, so as at least to save his pelt,
and the dull noise which the gun held at
short range made, as the charge pierced
the living flesh, Jeli thought he felt in his
own heart.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>"Now if you want a piece of advice
from me," said the factor, as he left him
there, "I'd not let the master lay eyes on
you, in spite of that bit of wages due you,
for you may be sure, he'd give it to you
with a vengeance!"</p>

<p>The factor went off together with Alfio,
taking along the other colts, which did not
once turn round to see what had become
of the <i>stellato</i>, but proceeded cropping the
grass along the ridge. The poor <i>stellato</i>
was left alone in the ravine waiting for the
knacker to flay him, its eyes were still wide
open, and its four legs stretched into the
air, for to stretch them up was the only
thing it could do.</p>

<p>Jeli, now that he had seen how the factor
had been able to aim at the colt, as it
painfully lifted its head in fear, and had
been courageous enough to fire off the gun
at it, no longer wept, but remained sitting
on a rock looking at the <i>stellato</i> till the
men came to take off the pelt. Now he
might go at his own pleasure and enjoy the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
<i>festa</i>, or stand in the square all day long
and see the gentlemen in the <i>café</i>, as best
pleased him, for now he no longer had
bread or a shelter, and it behooved him to
find a new <i>padrone</i>, if any one would take
him after the misfortune of the <i>stellato</i>.</p>

<p>Thus go things in this world:&mdash;While
Jeli was seeking a new employer, walking
about with his bag over his shoulder and
his staff in his hand, the band was playing
gayly in the square, with plumes in their
caps, and surrounded by a merry throng
of white hats thick as flies, and the gentlemen
were enjoying themselves as they sat
at their coffee. All the people were
dressed in holiday attire like the animals
of the fair, and in one corner of the square
was a lady, with a short gown and flesh-colored
stockings, making her appear bare-legged,
and she was pounding on a great
box before a great painted sheet on which
appeared a slaughter of Christians with
blood flowing in torrents, and, there among
the throng, gazing with open mouth, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
<i>massaro</i> Cola, whom he used to know when
he was at Passanitello, and he told him that
he would find him an employer, because
<i>compare</i> Isidoro Macca was in want of a
herdsman for his hogs.</p>

<p>"But I wouldn't say anything about
<i>stellato</i>," recommended <i>massaro</i> Cola. "A
misfortune like that might happen to any
one in the world. But it is best not to
talk about it."</p>

<p>So they went in search of <i>compare</i>
Macca, who was at the ball, and while
<i>massaro</i> Cola went to plead his cause, Jeli
waited outside in the street in the midst of
the throng, who were gazing in at the door
of the hall. In the big room, there was a
world of people jumping about enjoying
themselves, all flushed and perspiring, and
making a great trampling on the floor,
while above all was heard the <i>ron ron</i> of
the double bass, and as soon as one piece
of music, costing a <i>grano</i>,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> was finished
they would all lift their fingers to signify
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
that they wanted another; and the man of
the double bass would make a cross with a
piece of charcoal on the wall, to keep
account to the last, and then begin over
again.</p>

<p>"Those in there spend without thought,"
said Jeli, to himself. "That means that
they have their pockets full and are not in
trouble as I am, for lack of an employer,
and if they sweat and tire themselves out
in dancing, it is for their own pleasure, as
if they were paid by the day."</p>

<p><i>Massaro</i> Cola came back saying that
<i>compare</i> Macca needed no one.</p>

<p>Then Jeli turned away, and walked off
gloomily, gloomily.</p>

<p>Mara's home was toward Sant'Antonio,
where the houses climb up the mountainside,
facing the valley of la Canziria, all
green with prickly pears, and with the mill-wheels
churning the water into foam in
the lowlands by the stream. But Jeli
hadn't the courage to go in that direction,
now that they needed no one to watch the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
swine; and, making his way amid the
throng which jostled him and pushed him
without any thought of him, he seemed
more alone than ever he had been when he
was with his colts in the plains of Passanitello,
and he felt like weeping.</p>

<p>At last <i>massaro</i> Agrippino, wandering
about with his arms swinging, and enjoying
the <i>festa</i>, fell in with him in the square,
and shouted to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! Jeli! oh!" and took him home.</p>

<p>Mara was in gala dress, with such long
ear-rings that they hung down to her
cheeks, and she was standing on the
threshold with her hands folded, loaded
with rings, waiting till it should grow dark,
so as to go and see the fireworks.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mara to him, "so you have
come also for the <i>festa</i> of Saint John!"</p>

<p>Jeli did not want to go in because he
was shabbily dressed, but <i>massaro</i> Agrippino
forced him in saying that it was not
the first time they had ever seen each
other, and that he knew that he had come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
to the fair with his employer's colts. <i>Gnà</i>
Lia poured him out a good generous glass
of wine, and wanted to take him with them
to see the illuminations, together with the
<i>comari</i> and their other neighbors.</p>

<p>When they reached the square Jeli stood
with open mouth, wondering at the spectacle;
the whole square seemed a sea of fire
as when the steppes are burning, and the
reason was the great number of torches
which the devout lighted under the eyes of
the saint, who stood enjoying it all at the
entrance of <i>il Rosario</i>&mdash;all black under his
silver baldachin. The acolytes were coming
and going amid the flames like so
many demons, and there was, moreover, a
woman in loose attire and with dishevelled
hair, and with her eyes staring out of her
head, also engaged in lighting the candles,
and a priest in a black soutane and without
a hat, like one rendered crazy by
religion.</p>

<p>"There's the son of <i>massaro</i> Neri, the
factor of Saloni, and he is spending more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
than ten <i>lire</i> for rockets," said <i>gnà</i> Lia,
pointing to a young man who was going
round through the square holding two
rockets in each hand, just like candles, so
that all the women devoured him with their
eyes, and cried to him: "<i>Viva San Giovanni!</i>"</p>

<p>"His father is rich and owns more than
twenty head of cattle," added <i>massaro</i>
Agrippino.</p>

<p>Mara also knew well that he had carried
the great banner in the procession, and held
it as straight as a pillar&mdash;such a strong and
handsome youth was he.</p>

<p><i>Massaro</i> Neri's son seemed to have
heard them, and he set off his rockets for
Mara, making the wheel of fire before her,
and after this part of the fireworks was
over, he joined them, and took them to the
ball and to the cosmorama, where the new
world and the old world were to be seen
depicted, and he paid for them all, even
for Jeli, who followed behind the others
like a masterless cur, to see <i>massaro</i> Neri's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
son dancing with Mara, who whirled round
and crouched down like a dove on a roof,
and held daintily up the corner of her
apron, and <i>massaro</i> Neri's son gamboling
like a colt, so that <i>gnà</i> Lia wept like a
child at the consolation of the sight, and
<i>massaro</i> Agrippino nodded with his head
to signify that all was going to his mind.</p>

<p>At last when they were all tired, they
went out where the people were promenading,
and they were carried away by the
crowd as if they were in the midst of a
torrent, and there they saw the transparencies
lighted where the decapitation of Saint
John was represented with such faithfulness
that it would have moved the heart of a
Turk, and the saint kicked out his legs like
a goat under the hatchet. Near by the
band was playing under a great wooden
umbrella, all lighted up, and in the square
there was such a crowd that one would
have said never before had so many
Christians come to the fair.</p>

<p>Mara went holding <i>massaro</i> Neri's son's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
arm, as if she were a fine lady, and she
whispered into his ear and laughed, as if
she were having a fine time. Jeli was
utterly tired out, and actually went to sleep
sitting on the sidewalk till the first bombs
of the fireworks were sent up. At that
moment Mara was still by the side of
<i>massaro</i> Neri's son, leaning against him
with her hands clasped on his shoulder,
and in the different-colored lights from the
fireworks she seemed now all white and
now all rosy. When the last sparks died
away in the darkness of the sky, <i>massaro</i>
Neri's son turned toward her, with green
light on his face, and gave her a kiss.</p>

<p>Jeli said nothing, but at that instant all
that he had enjoyed till then changed into
poison, and he began once more to think
of his misfortunes, which he had for the
moment forgotten&mdash;that he was without
an employer&mdash;and knew not what to do,
nor where to go, that he had no food or
shelter; that the dogs might eat him as
they were eating the poor <i>stellato</i> left down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
in the bottom of the ravine, skinned to the
hoofs!</p>

<p>Meantime, around him the people were
still making merry in the darkness that
had ensued; Mara, with her companions,
was dancing and singing through the rock-paved
streets as they turned homeward.</p>

<p>"Good-night! Good-night&mdash;<i>buona notte</i>!"
shouted the people to one another, as they
were left at their own doors. Mara shouted
"good-night&mdash;<i>buona notte</i>!" in her musical
voice, and it expressed her happiness, and
<i>massaro</i> Neri's son did not see fit to leave
her while <i>massaro</i> Agrippino and <i>gnà</i> Lia
were disputing about the opening of the
house door. No one gave Jeli a thought,
till at last <i>massaro</i> Agrippino remembered
him, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Jeli.</p>

<p>"Come and see me to-morrow and I will
help you find a place. For to-night, go
back to the square where we have been
hearing the band play. You'll find a spot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
on some bench, and sleep out doors; you
must be used to that."</p>

<p>Jeli was used to that, but what pained
him was that Mara said nothing to him,
but left him there at the door as if he were
a beggar; and the next day when he came
back to see <i>massaro</i> Agrippino, he was
hardly alone with the girl before he said to
her,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>gnà</i> Mara! How you forget old
friends!"</p>

<p>"Oh, is that you, Jeli?" replied Mara.
"No, I haven't forgotten you. But I was
so tired after the fireworks!"</p>

<p>"You're in love with him aren't you&mdash;<i>massaro</i>
Neri's son?" demanded Jeli, twirling
his staff in his hands.</p>

<p>"What are you saying?" abruptly interposed
<i>gnà</i> Mara. "My mother is there
and hears everything you say."</p>

<p><i>Massaro</i> Agrippino found him a place as
shepherd at la Salonia, where <i>massaro</i>
Neri was factor, but as Jeli was not very
much skilled in taking care of sheep, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
had to be content with far smaller wages
than he had been having.</p>

<p>Now he attended faithfully to his flocks,
and strove to learn how cheese is made&mdash;the
ricotta and the <i>caciocavallo</i>, and all the
other products of the flocks; but in the
gossip that went on at eventide in the
yard, among the shepherds and <i>contadini</i>,
while the women were preparing the beans
for the soup, if ever <i>massaro</i> Neri's son
was mentioned as soon to marry <i>massaro</i>
Agrippino's Mara, Jeli said not a word,
and never dared open his mouth.</p>

<p>One time when the keeper insulted him,
by saying, jestingly, that Mara refused to
have anything more to do with him, after
every one had declared that they were to
be husband and wife, Jeli, as he went to
the pot where the milk was boiling, replied,
as he slowly shook in the rennet,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now Mara has grown to be so pretty,
she seems like a lady."</p>

<p>But as he was patient and laborious,
and quickly got hold of the secrets of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
business, even better than one who had
been born to it, and as he was accustomed
to be with animals, he came to love his
sheep as if they were his own, and for this
reason the distemper&mdash;<i>il male</i>&mdash;did not
do so much damage at la Salonia, and the
flock prospered, so that it was a delight for
<i>massaro</i> Neri every time that he came
to the estate, and the next year it was
no great trouble to induce the <i>padrone</i> to
increase Jeli's wages, so that he came to
have as much as he got in looking out for
the horses. And it was money well spent,
for Jeli never thought of reckoning up the
miles and miles that he travelled in search
of the best pasturage for his flock, and if
the sheep were with young or were sick, he
would take them to his saddle-bags and
carry the lambs in his arms, and they
would lick his face, thrusting their noses
out of his pocket, and they would even
suck his ears.</p>

<p>In the famous snow storm of Santa
Lucia's night, the snow fell four handbreadths
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
deep in the <i>lago morto</i> at la
Salonia, and all around for miles and miles
there was nothing else to be seen when day
came, and nothing would have been left of
the sheep but the ears, had not Jeli got up
three or four times in the course of the
night to drive the sheep into the yard, so
that the poor beasts shook the snow from
their backs and did not remain, as it were
buried, as was the case in so many of the
neighboring flocks&mdash;at least so <i>massaro</i>
Agrippino said when he came to give a
look to a field of beans which he had at la
Salonia, and he also said that that story of
<i>massaro</i> Neri's son marrying his daughter
Mara was a lie made up of whole cloth&mdash;that
Mara had some one else in mind.</p>

<p>"It was said they were to be married at
Christmas," said Jeli.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort; they aren't to
marry at all; it's all the gossip of envious
folks who meddle with others' business,"
replied <i>massaro</i> Agrippino.</p>

<p>But the keeper, who had known about it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
for some time, having heard it talked about
in town when he was there on Sunday, told
the story as it really was, after <i>massaro</i>
Agrippino had gone away.</p>

<p>"The engagement was broken because
<i>massaro</i> Neri's son had learned that
<i>massaro</i> Agrippino's Mara was keeping
company with Don Alfonso, the signorino,
who had known Mara from a little girl;
and <i>massaro</i> Neri had declared that his
son was to be a man respected as his
father was, and the only horns he wanted
in his house should be those of his oxen."</p>

<p>Jeli was present at this conversation, sitting
with the others in the circle at breakfast,
and at that instant was cutting his
bread. He still said nothing, but his appetite
left him for that day.</p>

<p>While he was driving his sheep out to
pasture he began to think of Mara, as she
had been when she was a little girl, when
they were together all day long wandering
through the <i>valle del Jacitano</i> and over the
<i>poggio alla Croce</i>, and how she stood looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
at him, with her chin in the air, while
he climbed up to the tree-tops after the
birds' nests; and he thought also of Don
Alfonso, who used to come and see him
from the neighboring villa, and how they
would stretch themselves out on their
bellies, stirring up crickets' nests with
straws. All these things he considered
and reconsidered for hours and hours, as
he sat on the edge of the brook, holding
his knees between his arms, and thinking
of the tall walnuts of Tebidi, and the thick
bushes in the valleys and the slopes of the
hills, green with sumachs, and the gray
olive trees spreading through the valley
like a fog, and the red-tiled roof of the
house, and the campanile that looked like
"a handle of a salt cellar" among the
oranges of the garden.</p>

<p>Here the campagna stretched away
naked, desert, speckled with dried grass,
blending silently with the distant horizon.</p>

<p>In Spring the bean pods had begun to
fill out when Mara came to la Salonia with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
her father and mother and the boy and
the ass, to pick the beans, and they all
came together to sleep at the farm for two
or three days during the picking.</p>

<p>In this way Jeli saw the girl morning
and evening, and they would sit together
on the wall of the sheep-fold and talk,
while the boy looked after the sheep.</p>

<p>"It seems as if I were at Tebidi again,"
said Mara, "when we were little things,
and used to stand on the foot bridge."</p>

<p>Jeli also remembered everything, though
he said little, being always a judicious
youth, and of few words.</p>

<p>When the harvest was over, and the eve
of parting had come, Mara went out to talk
with the young man, just as he was making
"ricotto cheese," and he was wholly intent
in skimming the whey with his ladle.</p>

<p>"Now I'll say <i>addio</i>," said she, "for to-morrow
we return to Vizzini."</p>

<p>"How have the beans gone?"</p>

<p>"Bad! <i>la lupa</i><a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> has eaten them all this
year."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>"It depends on the rain which has been
scarce," said Jeli. "We have had to kill
even the lambs because there hasn't been
enough feed for them. Over all of la
Salonia there hasn't been three inches of
grass."</p>

<p>"But that doesn't affect you. You always
have your wages, good year or bad."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so," said he. "But it disgusts
me to give those poor creatures to
the butcher."</p>

<p>"Do you remember when you came for
the <i>festa</i> of Saint John, and were left without
a <i>padrone</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember."</p>

<p>"It was my father who got you a place
here with <i>massaro</i> Neri."</p>

<p>"And why didn't you marry <i>massaro</i>
Neri's son?"</p>

<p>"Because it wasn't the will of God. My
father has been unlucky," she continued,
after a brief pause. "Since we came to
Marineo, everything has gone ill with us.
The beans, the corn, that piece of vineyard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
that we have yonder. Then my brother
went off to the army, and we lost a mule
that was worth forty <i>onze</i>."</p>

<p>"I know," said Jeli, "the bay mule."</p>

<p>"Now, that we have lost all our property,
who would want to marry me?"</p>

<p>Mara was breaking up a twig of briar
while she said this, with her chin in her
bosom, and, with her elbow, she gently
nudged Jeli's elbow without appearing to
mean it. But Jeli, with his eyes on the
churn, also made no response, and she
went on,&mdash;</p>

<p>"At Tebidi they used to say that you
and I would be husband and wife, do you
remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jeli, and he laid his ladle on
the top of the churn. "But I am a poor
shepherd, and I can not pretend to a
<i>massaro's</i> daughter like you."</p>

<p>La Mara remained silent for a little
while, and then she said, "If you want
me, I will willingly be yours."</p>

<p>"Really?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, really."</p>

<p>"And what will <i>massaro</i> Agrippino say
to it?"</p>

<p>"My father says that now that you know
your trade, and since you are not one of
those who waste their wages, but make one
<i>soldo</i> into two, and do not eat to consume
bread, in time you will come to have flocks
of your own, and will be rich."</p>

<p>"If that is so," said Jeli, in conclusion,
"I will gladly take you."</p>

<p>"There," said Mara, as soon as it had
grown dark and the sheep were relapsing
into silence, "if you want a kiss, I will give
you one, because we are going to be husband
and wife."</p>

<p>Jeli took one in "holy peace," and not
knowing what to say, added, "I have always
loved you, even when you were going to
desert me for the son of <i>massaro</i> Neri."</p>

<p>But he had not the heart to speak of the
other one.</p>

<p>"Don't you see? We were meant for
one another," said Mara, in conclusion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p><i>Massaro</i> Agrippino, in fact, said "Yes,"
and <i>gnà</i> Lia put on a new gown, and she
had a pair of velvet trousers made for their
son-in-law. Mara was as lovely and fresh
as a rose, with her white mantellina, reminding
you of the Paschal lamb, and that
amber necklace which made her neck look
so white; so, when Jeli walked through the
street at her side, he marched stiffly and
erect, dressed in his new cloth and velvet
suit, and he did not dare even blow his
nose with his red silk handkerchief, lest he
should make a fool of himself; and the
neighbors and all who knew the story of
Don Alfonso laughed in his face.</p>

<p>When Mara said "<i>sissignore</i>," and the
priest made her Jeli's wife with a grand
sign of the cross, Jeli took her home, and
it seemed to him as if they had given him
all the gold of the Madonna, and all the
lands that he had seen with his eyes.</p>

<p>"Now that we are husband and wife,"
said he, when they reached their house, as
he was sitting in front of her, and trying to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
appear very humble, "now that we are
husband and wife, I may tell you that it
does not seem to me true as you pretended&mdash;you
might have had ever so many
better husbands than I&mdash;so beautiful and
gracious you are."</p>

<p>The poor fellow could not find anything
else to say, and he could not contain his
delight to see Mara setting and arranging
everything through the house, and playing
<i>la padrona</i>. He found it impossible to tear
himself away to return to la Salonia; when
he started Monday, he was very slow in
arranging in the pack of the ass, his saddle-bags,
and his cloak, and his umbrella.</p>

<p>"You ought to come to la Salonia, yourself,"
he said to his wife, who was watching
him from the door-step. "You ought
to come with me."</p>

<p>But the young woman began to laugh,
and replied that she was not born to look
after sheep, and had no reason to go to la
Salonia.</p>

<p>Truly, Mara was not born for tending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
sheep, and she was not accustomed to the
January tramontana wind, which stiffens
the hand on the staff, and it seems as if
your fingers would drop off, or to furious
storms that come, when the water
penetrates to your very bones, and again,
when the dust drives choking through the
streets, when the sheep travel under the
boiling sun, or to the hard bed on the
ground, and the mouldy bread, and the
long, silent, solitary days, when through
the arid fields nothing else is seen in the
distance but occasionally some sun-burned
peasant driving his ass silently along over
the white, interminable road.</p>

<p>Jeli knew at least that Mara was warm
and comfortable under the quilts, or was
spinning in front of the fire, talking with
the women of the neighborhood, or was
enjoying the sun on the balcony, while he
was returning from the pasture tired and
thirsty, or wet through with the rain, or
when the wind drifted the snow back of
his hut and put out his fire of branches.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>Every month Mara went to receive the
wages from the <i>padrone</i>, and they lacked
neither eggs nor fowls, nor oil in the lamp,
nor wine in the jug. Twice a month Jeli
came home to see her, and she would stand
on the balcony looking for him with her
spindle in her hand, and after he had left
the ass in the stable and removed his pack
and filled the rack with oats, and placed
the wood under the shed in the yard, or
whatever he brought into the kitchen,
Mara would help him hang his cloak on
the nail and take off his leather leggings
before the hearth, and pour him out a
glass of wine, and set to work to boil the
soup and get the table ready, quiet and
thoughtful, like a good housewife, while
talking of this thing and that,&mdash;of the
brooding hen that was setting, of the cloth
that was on the loom, of the calf which
they were raising, never forgetting anything
of what she had been doing.</p>

<p>Jeli, when he found himself at home, felt
that he was more important than the pope.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<p>But on the eve of Santa Barbara he
came home unexpectedly late, when all
the lights were out in the street and the
town clock was striking midnight. He
came in because the mare which the <i>padrone</i>
had left out at pasture had been suddenly
taken sick, and he saw that it was a
case that required the services of the farrier
quickly, and he had wanted to bring him to
town in spite of the rain that was falling
like a torrent, and the muddy roads into
which he sunk half up to his knees.</p>

<p>Knock and call as loud as he might behind
the door, he had to wait half an hour
under the eaves, while the water ran out
at his heels. At last his wife came to open
for him, and began to scold worse than if
it had been herself who had been obliged
to wander across country in such a tempest.</p>

<p>"Oh, what's the matter?" she demanded.
"How you frightened me coming at this
time o' night! Does it seem to you a
proper Christian time to come? To-morrow
I shall be ill!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>"Go back to bed, I will start up a fire."</p>

<p>"No, I'll have to go and get some
wood."</p>

<p>"I'll go."</p>

<p>"No, I say."</p>

<p>When Mara returned with the wood in
her arms Jeli said to her, "Why did you
leave the door to the yard open? Was
there not enough wood in the kitchen?"</p>

<p>"No, I went to get it under the shed."</p>

<p>She let him kiss her, coldly, coldly, and
turned her head in another direction.</p>

<p>"His wife lets him wait at the door,"
said the neighbors, "when there is another
bird in the nest."</p>

<p>But Jeli knew nothing about the fact that
his wife was untrue to him, nor did any one
care to tell him, because it could surely be
of no consequence, for he had taken the
woman with a damaged reputation after
<i>massaro</i> Neri's son had jilted her, because
he knew of the story of Don Alfonso. But
Jeli seemed to live happy and contented in
the shame of it, and grew as fat as a pig;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
for the proverb has it "horns are lean but
they make the house fat." At last, one
time, the herdman's boy told it to him in
his face, while they were scuffling about
the pieces of cheese that had been stolen.</p>

<p>"Now that Don Alfonso has taken your
wife you consider yourself his brother-in-law,
and you are proud enough to be a
crowned king with those horns on your
head."</p>

<p>The factor and the keeper expected to
see blood flow for those insulting words,
but on the contrary Jeli stood stupefied, as
if he had not heard, or as if it concerned
him not, wearing the dull face of an ox
whose horns really fitted him.</p>

<p>Now that Easter was at hand the factor
sent all the men of the estate to confession,
with the hope that through the fear of God
they would not do any more stealing. Jeli
also went, and at the church entrance
sought for the boy with whom he had exchanged
those hot words, and he threw his
arms around his neck, saying,&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>"The confessor has bade me pardon
you; but I am not angry with you for such
gossip; and if you will not steal any more
of the cheese from me, I will not take any
further notice of what you said to me in
passion."</p>

<p>It was from that moment that they nicknamed
him <i>Corno d'ore</i>&mdash;"Gold horns"&mdash;and
the nickname stuck to him and all his,
even after he had washed his horns in blood.</p>

<p>La Mara also went to confession and returned
from the church all wrapped up in
her mantellina, and with her eyes cast down,
so that she seemed a genuine <i>Santa Maria
Maddelena</i>. Jeli, who was silently waiting
for her on the balcony, when he saw her
coming in that way, seeming as if she had
the Holy Presence in her heart, kept looking
at her,&mdash;pale, pale from his foot to his
head as if he saw her for the first time, or
as if his Mara had been changed for him,
and he seemed hardly to dare to lift his
eyes to her while she was shaking the cloth
and setting the table, calm and neat as ever.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>Then after long thinking he put the
question to her: "Is it true that you keep
company with Don Alfonso?"</p>

<p>Mara looked him full in the face with
those black eyes of hers and made the sign
of the cross.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to make me commit
a sin on this day?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I did not believe it, because Don Alfonso
and I were always together when we
were boys, and there never passed a day
that he did not come to Tebidi when he
was in the country there; and then he is
rich, and has bushels of money, and if he
wanted women he might get married, nor
would he lack anything, either clothes to
wear, or bread to eat."</p>

<p>But Mara was really angry, and she began
to scold so that the poor fellow did not
dare lift his nose from his plate.</p>

<p>At last, so that that gift of God which
they were eating might not turn into poison,
Mara changed the conversation, and asked
him if he had thought of weeding that little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
plot of flax which they had sowed in the
bean field.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Jeli, "and the flax will do
well."</p>

<p>"If that is so," said Mara, "this spring
I will make you two new shirts which will
keep you warm."</p>

<p>In truth Jeli did not realize what
"cuckold" meant, and he did not know
what jealousy was. Every new thing found
difficulty in getting into his head, and this
became so great that, in making its way in,
it played devilish work, especially when he
saw his Mara before him so beautiful and
white and neat, and how she had herself
chosen him, and how he had thought about
her so many years, and so many years, ever
since he was a young boy, so that the day
when they told him that she was going to
marry some one else, he had had no heart
to eat anything or to drink all day long.</p>

<p>Then again he thought of Don Alfonso,
who had been his companion so many
times, and how he had always brought him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
strange feeling within his heart. Don Alfonso
had grown so tall that he no longer
seemed the same person, and now he had
a full beard, curly like his hair, and a velvet
coat and a gold chain across his waistcoat.
But he recognized Jeli, and patted him on
the shoulder in salutation. He had come
with the <i>padrone</i> of the estate and a number
of friends to have a jollification while
the sheep-shearing was in progress, and
Mara also came unexpectedly, under the
pretext that she was pregnant, and longed
for some fresh ricotto.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful warm day in the pale
fields, with the grain in flower and the
long green rows of the vines; the sheep
were gamboling and bleating for delight,
at feeling themselves freed from all that
weight of wool, and in the kitchen, the
women had made a great fire to cook all
the provisions that the <i>padrone</i> had brought
for the dinner.</p>

<p>The gentlemen, while they were waiting,
had sat down in the shade under the carob-trees,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
and were playing tambourines and
bag-pipes, and dancing with the girls of
the estate, as if they were all of the same
class.</p>

<p>Jeli, meantime, went on with his work
shearing the sheep, and felt something
within him, without knowing what, like
a thorn, like a nail, like a pair of shears,
working within him, slowly, slowly, like a
poison.</p>

<p>The <i>padrone</i> had ordered that they
should kill a couple of goats, and the yearling
sheep, and some chickens, and a turkey
cock. In fact, he was going to do
things on a grand scale, and lavishly, so as
to do honor to his friends; and while all
those creatures were squealing under the
death-agony, and the goats were screaming
under the knife, Jeli felt his knees tremble,
and little by little, it seemed to him that
the wool that he was shearing, and the
grass in which the sheep were leaping,
were stained with blood.</p>

<p>"Don't go," he said to Mara, when Don
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Alfonso called her to come and dance with
the rest. "Don't go, Mara."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't want you to go. Do not go."</p>

<p>"I hear them calling me."</p>

<p>He uttered not another intelligible word
while he stayed with the sheep that he was
shearing. Mara shrugged her shoulders,
and went to dance. She was blushing
with delight, and her two black eyes shone
like two stars, and she smiled so that there
was a gleam of white teeth, and all the gold
ornaments tossed and scintillated on her
wrists and on her bosom, so that she
seemed like the Madonna herself.</p>

<p>Jeli had arisen to his full height, with
the long shears in his hand, and white in
face, as white as once he had seen his
father, the cowherd, when he was trembling
with fever in front of the fire in the hovel.</p>

<p>Suddenly, when he saw how Don Alfonso,
with his curling beard and his velvet coat,
and the gold chain at his waistcoat, took
Mara by the hand to dance&mdash;then&mdash;only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
at that moment that he touched her did he
fling himself on him and cut his throat
with one stroke, as if he had been a goat.</p>

<p>Later, while they were leading him off
to the judge, bound, wholly unmanned, without
daring to make the least resistance,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How," said he, "should I not have
killed him. He robbed me of my Mara!"</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span>uriddu Macca, <i>gnà</i> Nunzia's
son, after returning from the army,
used every Sunday to strut like a peacock
through the square in his bersegliere uniform
and red cap, looking like the fortune-teller
as he sets up his stand with his cage
of canaries. The girls on their way to
Mass gave stolen glances at him from behind
their mantellinas, and the urchins
buzzed round him like flies.</p>

<p>He had brought back with him, also, a
pipe with the king on horseback carved so
naturally that it seemed actually alive, and
he scratched his matches on the seat of his
trousers, lifting his leg as if he were going
to give a kick.</p>

<p>But in spite of all this, Lola, the daughter
of <i>massaro</i> Angelo, had not shown herself
either at Mass or on the balcony, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
reason that she was going to wed a man
from Licodia, a carter who had four Sortino
mules in his stable.</p>

<p>At first, when Turiddu heard about it,
<i>santo diavolone!</i> he threatened to disembowel
him, threatened to kill him&mdash;that
fellow from Licodia! But he did nothing
of the sort; he contented himself with
going under the fair one's window, and
singing all the spiteful songs he knew.</p>

<p>"Has <i>gnà</i> Nunzia's Turiddu nothing else
to do," asked the neighbors, "except spending
his nights singing like a lone sparrow?"</p>

<p>At length, he met Lola on her way back
from the pilgrimage to the Madonna del
Pericolo, and when she saw him, she turned
neither red nor white, just as if it were
none of her affair at all.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>compare</i> Turiddu, I was told that
you returned the first of the month."</p>

<p>"But I have been told of something quite
different!" replied the other. "Is it true
that you are to marry <i>compare</i> Alfio, the
carter?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>"Such is God's will," replied Lola, drawing
the two ends of her handkerchief under
her chin.</p>

<p>"God's will in your case is done with
a snap and a spring; to suit yourself!
And it was God's will, was it, that I should
return from so far to find this fine state of
things, <i>gnà</i> Lola!"</p>

<p>The poor fellow still tried to bluster, but
his voice grew hoarse, and he followed the
girl, tossing his head so that the tassel of
his cap swung from side to side on his
shoulders. To tell the truth, she felt really
sorry to see him wearing such a long face,
but she had not the heart to deceive him
with fine speeches.</p>

<p>"Listen, <i>compare</i> Turiddu," she said to
him at last, "Let me join my friends.
What would be said in town if I were seen
with you?"</p>

<p>"You are right," replied Turiddu, "Now
that you are going to marry <i>compare</i> Alfio,
who has four mules in his stable, it is best
not to let people's tongues wag about you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
But my mother, poor soul, was obliged to
sell our bay mule, and that little plot of
vineyard on the highway while I was off in
the army. The time 'when Berta spun,' is
over and gone, and you no longer think of
the time when we used to talk together
from the window looking into the yard, and
you gave me that handkerchief before I
went away, and God knows how many
tears I shed into it at going so far that
even the name of our place is lost! So
good-by, <i>gnà</i> Lola,&mdash;Let's pretend it's
rained and cleared off, and our friendship
is ended."<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><i>Gnà</i> Lola married the carter, and on
Sundays used to go out on the balcony
with her hands crossed on her stomach, to
show off all the heavy gold rings that her
husband gave to her. Turiddu kept up his
habit of going back and forth through the
street with his pipe in his mouth, his hands
in his pockets, and an air of unconcern, and
ogling the girls; but it gnawed his heart
that Lola's husband had so much money,
and that she pretended not to see him when
he passed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll get even with her, under her very
eyes; the vile beast," he muttered.</p>

<p>Opposite <i>compare</i> Alfio lived <i>massaro</i>
Cola, the vinedresser, who was as rich as
a pig, and had one daughter at home.
Turiddu said and did all he could to
become <i>massaro</i> Cola's workman, and he
began to frequent the house, and make
sweet speeches to the girl.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go and say sweet things
to <i>gnà</i> Lola?" asked Santa.</p>

<p>"<i>Gnà</i> Lola is a fine lady. <i>Gnà</i> Lola
has married a crowned king now!"</p>

<p>"I don't deserve crowned kings!"</p>

<p>"You are worth a hundred Lolas, and
I know some one who wouldn't look at <i>la
gnà</i> Lola or her saint when you are by, for
<i>gnà</i> Lola isn't worthy to wear your shoes,
no, she isn't!"</p>

<p>"The fox when he couldn't get at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
grapes said, 'How beautiful you are, <i>racinedda
mia</i>,' my little grape!"</p>

<p>"Ohè! hands off, <i>compare</i> Turiddu!"</p>

<p>"Are you afraid that I will eat you?"</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of you or of your
God."</p>

<p>"Eh! your mother was from Licodia,
we all know that! You have quarrelsome
blood. Uh! How I could eat you with
my eyes!"</p>

<p>"Eat me then with your eyes, for we
should not have a crumb left, but meantime
help me up with this bundle."</p>

<p>"I would lift up the whole house for you,
yes, I would!"</p>

<p>She, so as not to blush, threw at him a
stick of wood which was within reach, and
by a miracle didn't hit him.</p>

<p>"Let's have done, for chattering never
picked grapes."</p>

<p>"If I were rich I should try to get a wife
like you, <i>gnà</i> Santa."</p>

<p>"I shall never marry a crowned king like
<i>gnà</i> Lola, but I have my dowry as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
she, whenever the Lord shall send me anyone."</p>

<p>"We know you are rich, we know it."</p>

<p>"If you know it, say no more, for father
is coming, and I shouldn't like to have him
find me in the court-yard."</p>

<p>The old father began to turn up his nose,
but the girl pretended not to notice it, because
the tassel of the bersegliere's cap had
set her heart to fluttering, and was constantly
dancing before her eyes. When
the <i>babbo</i> put Turiddu out of the house, his
daughter opened the window for him, and
stood chatting with him all the evening
long, so that the whole neighborhood talked
of nothing else.</p>

<p>"I'm madly in love with you," said Turiddu,
"and I am losing my sleep and my
appetite."</p>

<p>"How absurd!"</p>

<p>"I wish I were Victor Emmanuel's son,
so as to marry you."</p>

<p>"How absurd!"</p>

<p>"By the Madonna, I would eat you like
bread!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>"How absurd!"</p>

<p>"Ah! on my honor!"</p>

<p>"Ah! <i>mamma mia!</i>"</p>

<p>Lola, who was listening every evening,
hidden behind the vase of basil, and turning
red and white, one day called Turiddu:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And so, <i>compare</i> Turiddu, old friends
don't speak to each other any more?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ma!</i>" sighed the young man, "blessed
is he who can speak to you."</p>

<p>"If you have any desire to speak to me,
you know where I live," replied Lola.</p>

<p>Turiddu went to see her so frequently
that Santa noticed it, and shut the window
in his face. The neighbors looked at him
with a smile or with a shake of the head
when the bersegliere passed. Lola's husband
was making a round of the fairs with
his mules.</p>

<p>"Sunday I am going to confession, for
last night I dreamed of black grapes," said
Lola.</p>

<p>"Put it off, put it off" begged Turiddu.</p>

<p>"No, Easter is coming, and my husband
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
will want to know why I haven't been to
confession."</p>

<p>"Ah," murmured <i>massaro</i> Cola's Santa,
as she was waiting on her knees before the
confessional for her turn, while Lola was
making a clean breast of her sins. "On
my soul, I will not send you to Rome for
your punishment!"</p>

<p><i>Compare</i> Alfio came home with his
mules; he was loaded with money, and he
brought to his wife for a present, a handsome
new dress for the holidays.</p>

<p>"You are right to bring her gifts," said
his neighbor Santa, "because while you are
away your wife adorns your house for you."</p>

<p><i>Compare</i> Alfio was one of those carters
who wear their hats over one ear, and when
he heard his wife spoken of in such a way
he changed color as if he had been knifed.</p>

<p>"<i>Santo diavolone!</i>" he exclaimed, "if
you haven't seen aright, I will not leave
you eyes to weep with, you or your whole
family."</p>

<p>"I am not used to weeping!" replied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Santa, "I did not weep even when I saw
with these eyes <i>gnà</i> Nunzia's Turiddu going
into your wife's house at night!"</p>

<p>"It is well," replied <i>compare</i> Alfio,
"many thanks!"</p>

<p>Turiddu, now that the cat was at home,
no longer went out on the street by day,
and he whiled away the tedium at the inn
with his friends; and on Easter eve they
had on the table a dish of sausages.</p>

<p>When <i>compare</i> Alfio came in, Turiddu
realized, merely by the way in which he
fixed his eyes on him, that he had come to
settle that affair, and he laid his fork on the
plate.</p>

<p>"Have you any commands for me, <i>compare</i>
Alfio?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No favors to ask, <i>compare</i> Turiddu;
it's some time since I have seen you, and
I wanted to speak concerning something
you know about."</p>

<p>Turiddu at first had offered him a glass,
but <i>compare</i> Alfio refused it with a wave of
his hand. Then Turiddu got up and said
to him,&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>"Here I am, <i>compare</i> Alfio."</p>

<p>The carter threw his arms around his
neck.</p>

<p>"If to-morrow morning you will come to
the prickly pears of la Canziria, we can
talk that matter over, <i>compare</i>."</p>

<p>"Wait for me on the street at daybreak,
and we will go together."</p>

<p>With these words they exchanged the
kiss of defiance. Turiddu bit the carter's
ear, and thus made the solemn oath not to
fail him.</p>

<p>The friends had silently left the sausages,
and accompanied Turiddu to his
home. <i>Gnà</i> Nunzia, poor creature, waited
for him till late every evening.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Turiddu, "do you remember
when I went as a soldier, that you
thought I should never come back any
more? Give me a good kiss as you did
then, for to-morrow morning I am going
far away."</p>

<p>Before daybreak he got his spring-knife,
which he had hidden under the hay, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
he had gone to serve his time in the army,
and started for the prickly-pear trees of la
Canziria.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gesummaria! where are you going
in such haste!" cried Lola in great apprehension,
while her husband was getting
ready to go out.</p>

<p>"I am not going far," replied <i>compare</i>
Alfio. "But it would be better for you if
I never came back."</p>

<p>Lola in her nightdress was praying at the
foot of the bed, and pressing to her lips
the rosary which Fra Bernardino had
brought to her from the Holy places, and
reciting all the Ave Marias that she could
say.</p>

<p>"<i>Compare</i> Alfio," began Turiddu, after he
had gone a little distance by the side of
his companion, who walked in silence with
his cap down over his eyes, "as God is
true I know that I have done wrong, and I
should let myself be killed. But before I
came out, I saw my old mother, who got
up to see me off, under the pretence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
tending the hens. Her heart had a presentiment,
and as the Lord is true, I will
kill you like a dog, so that my poor old
mother may not weep."</p>

<p>"All right," replied <i>compare</i> Alfio, stripping
off his waistcoat. "Then we will
both of us hit hard."</p>

<p>Both of them were skilful fencers. Turiddu
was first struck, and was quick
enough to receive it in the arm. When
he returned it, he returned it well, and
wounded the other in the groin.</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>compare</i> Turiddu! so you really
intend to kill me, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I gave you fair warning; since I
saw my old mother in the hen-yard, it
seems to me I have her all the time before
my eyes."</p>

<p>"Keep them well open, those eyes of
yours," cried <i>compare</i> Alfio, "for I am going
to give you back good measure."</p>

<p>As he stood on guard, all doubled up, so
as to keep his left hand on his wound,
which pained him, and almost trailing his

elbow on the ground, he swiftly picked up
a handful of dust, and flung it into his adversary's
eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah!" screamed Turiddu, blinded, "I
am dead."</p>

<p>He tried to save himself, by making desperate
leaps backwards, but <i>compare</i> Alfio
overtook him with another thrust in the
stomach, and a third in the throat.</p>

<p>"And that makes three! that is for the
house which you have adorned for me!
Now your mother will let the hens alone."</p>

<p>Turiddu staggered a short distance
among the prickly pears, and then fell like
a stone. The blood foaming, gurgled in
his throat, and he could not even cry,
"<i>Ah! mamma mia!</i>"</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">S</span>he was tall and lean; but she had a
firm, full bust, and yet she was no
longer young; her complexion was brunette,
but pallid as if she had always suffered
from malaria, and this pallor set forth
two big eyes and fresh rosy lips that seemed
to eat you.</p>

<p>In the village she was called <i>la Lupa</i>&mdash;the
She-Wolf&mdash;because she was never
satisfied. Women made the sign of the
cross when they saw her pass, always alone
like a big ugly hound, with the vagabond
and suspicious gait of a famished wolf; she
would bewitch their sons and their husbands
in the twinkling of an eye with her
red lips and she made them fall in love
with her merely by looking at them out of
those big Satanic eyes of hers, even if they
were before Santa Agrippina's altar.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately <i>la Lupa</i> never came to
church at Easter or at Christmas, nor to
hear Mass or to make confession. <i>Padre</i>
Angiolino of Santa Maria di Gesù, a true
servant of God, had lost his soul on her
account.</p>

<p>Maricchia,&mdash;poor girl, pretty and clever
she was,&mdash;secretly wept because she was
<i>la Lupa's</i> daughter, and no one had offered
to marry her though she had nice clothes
in her bureau, and her own little piece of
land in the sun, like every other girl of the
village.</p>

<p>One time <i>la Lupa</i> fell in love with a
handsome youth who had just served out
his time in the army, and had come home
and was helping to reap the notary's harvest
with her; for surely it means to be in
love when she felt the flesh burn under the
fustian shift, and on looking at him to experience
the thirst that one has in hot June
days down in the low-lands.</p>

<p>But he went on with his work, undisturbed,
with his nose on his sheaves, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
he said to her, "Oh, what's the matter,
<i>gnà</i> Pina?"</p>

<p>In the immense fields where the only
sound was the rustle of the grasshoppers
flying up, while the sun was pouring down
his hottest beams perpendicularly, <i>la Lupa</i>
was heaping up sheaf on sheaf, and pile on
pile, without ever showing any signs of
fatigue, without one moment straightening
herself up, without once touching her lips
to the water jug, so as to stick close to
Nanni's heels as he reaped and reaped;
and now and again he would ask,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do you want, <i>gnà</i> Pina?"</p>

<p>One evening she told him, it was while
the men were sleeping in the threshing-floor,
weary of the long day's work and the
dogs were howling through the vast black
campagna,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I want you! you are as handsome as the
sun and as sweet as honey; I want you!"</p>

<p>"But I want your daughter&mdash;I want the
young calf," said Nanni, laughing at his
own joke.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<p><i>La Lupa</i> thrust her hands into the masses
of her hair, scratching her temples, without
saying a word, and went off and was not
seen again in the harvest field. But the
following October she saw Nanni again at
the time when they were pressing the oil,
because he worked near her house, and the
rattle of the press kept her awake all night.</p>

<p>"Take a bag of olives," she said to her
daughter, "and come with me."</p>

<p>Nanni was shoveling the olives into the
hopper and shouting "Ohi" to the mule to
keep it going.</p>

<p>"Do you want my daughter Maricchia?"
demanded <i>gnà</i> Pina.</p>

<p>"What dowry will you give with your
daughter Maricchia?" replied Nanni.</p>

<p>"She has her father's things, and besides
I will give her my house; it will be
enough for me if you'll let me have a corner
in the kitchen to spread out a mattress
in."</p>

<p>"If that is so, we can talk about it at
Christmas," said Nanni. Nanni was all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
grease and dirt from the olives put to fermenting,
and Maricchia would not have
him on any account; but her mother
grabbed her by the hair as they stood in
front of the hearth and hissed through her
set teeth,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you don't take him, I'll kill you."</p>

<p><i>La Lupa</i> looked ill, and the people remarked:
"When the devil was old the
devil a monk would be." She no longer
went wandering about; she stood no more
at her doorway looking out with those eyes
as of one possessed.</p>

<p>Her son-in-law, when she fixed those eyes
on his face, always began to laugh, and
would pull out his cloth talisman, with its
effigy of the Madonna, to cross himself with.</p>

<p>Maricchia stayed at home to nurse her
children, and her mother went out to work in
the fields with the men, just like a man,&mdash;to
weed, to dig, to guide the animals, to
dress the vines, whether it were during the
Greek-Levant winds<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> of January, or during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
the August sirocco, when mules let their
heads droop, and men sleep prone on their
bellies under the shadow of the North wall.</p>

<p>In that time between vespers and nones,
when, according to the saying, no good
woman is seen going about, <i>gnà</i> Pina was
the only living creature to be seen wandering
across the campagna, over the fiery hot
stones of the narrow streets, among the
parched stubble of the wide, wide fields
that stretched away into the burning haze
toward cloudy Etna, where the sky hangs
heavy on the horizon.</p>

<p>"Wake up!" said <i>la Lupa</i> to Nanni, who
was asleep in the ditch next the dusty
harvest-field, with his head on his arms.
"Wake up, for I've brought you some wine
to cool your throat."</p>

<p>Nanni opened his eyes, half awake, and
saw her sitting up straight and pale before
him, with her swelling breast, and her eyes
as black as coal, and drew back waving his
arms,&mdash;</p>

<p>"No! a good woman does not go about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
between vespers and nones," groaned
Nanni, thrusting his face in amongst the
dried weeds of the ditch as far as he could,
and putting his fingers into his hair. "Go
away! Get you gone! And don't you
come to the threshing-floor any more."</p>

<p>She turned and went away,&mdash;<i>la Lupa</i>,&mdash;knotting
up her splendid tresses again,
looking down steadily as she made her way
among the hot stubble, with her eyes black
as coal.</p>

<p>But she did go back to the threshing-floor,
and Nanni no longer reproached her;
and when she failed to come, in that hour
between vespers and nones, he went, and
with perspiration on his brow, waited for
her at the top of the white deserted footpath,
but afterwards he would thrust his
hands through his hair, and every time he
would say, "Go away! Go away! Don't
come to the threshing-floor again."</p>

<p>Maricchia wept night and day, and she
looked into her mother's face with eyes
blazing with tears and jealousy, like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
<i>lupachiotta</i>,
a young wolf herself, every time
that she saw her coming back from the
fields, silent and pale.</p>

<p>"Vile! <i>scellerata!</i>" she would say, "Vile
mamma."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!"</p>

<p>"Thief! thief!"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!"</p>

<p>"I'll go to the <i>brigadiere</i>!"<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>And she actually went with her infants
in her arms, without a sign of fear, and
without shedding a tear, like a crazy
woman, because now she passionately
loved that husband whom she had been
forced to marry, greasy and dirty as he
was from the olives set to fermenting.</p>

<p>The <i>brigadiere</i> summoned Nanni, and
threatened him with the galleys and the
gallows. Nanni began to weep, and pull
his hair; he denied nothing, did not try to
justify himself.</p>

<p>"The temptation was too much," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
he, "'twas the temptation of hell." He
flung himself at the <i>brigadiere's</i> feet, begging
him to send him to the galleys.</p>

<p>"For mercy's sake, <i>Signor brigadiere</i>, take
me out of this hell! Have me shot! Send
me to prison! Don't let me see her ever
again! never again!"</p>

<p>"No," replied <i>la Lupa</i>, to the <i>brigadiere's</i>
question. "I kept a corner of the
kitchen to sleep in when I gave him my
house as my daughter's dowry. The house
is mine. I do not intend to go away."</p>

<p>Shortly after, Nanni was kicked in the
chest by a mule, and was like to die; but the
priest refused to bring him the Holy Unction
unless <i>la Lupa</i> was out of the house.</p>

<p><i>La Lupa</i> went away, and her son-in-law
was then permitted to pass away like a
good Christian; he confessed and partook
of the Sacrament with such signs of penitence
and contrition that all the neighbors
and inquisitive visitors wept as they surrounded
the dying man's bed.</p>

<p>And it would have been better for him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
if he had died then and there, before the
devil had a chance to return to tempt him,
and take possession of him, mind and body,
when he got well again.</p>

<p>"Let me be!" he said to <i>la Lupa</i>; "for
mercy's sake, leave me in peace! I have
seen death with my own eyes! Poor
Maricchia is in despair. Now the whole
region knows about it! If I don't see
you, it's better for you and better for me."</p>

<p>And he would rather have put his eyes
out, than see <i>la Lupa's</i>, for when hers were
fastened on him, they made him lose soul
and body. He did not know what to do to
overcome the enchantment. He paid for
Masses to be sung for the souls in Purgatory,
and he went for aid to the priest and
the <i>brigadiere</i>. At Easter he went to confession,
and as a penance, publicly stood
on the flint stones of the holy ground in
front of the church, putting out six handbreadths
of tongue, and then, when <i>la Lupa</i>
returned to tempt him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"See here," said he, "don't you come on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
the threshing-floor again, because if you
do come to seek me again, as sure as God
exists, I'll kill you."</p>

<p>"All right, kill me!" replied <i>la Lupa</i>.
"It makes no difference to me; but I
can not live without you."</p>

<p>When he saw her afar off coming
through the green corn field, he left off
pruning the vines, and went and got his
axe from the elm.</p>

<p><i>La Lupa</i> saw him coming to meet her,
with his face pale and his eyes rolling
wildly, with the axe shining in the sun; but
she did not hesitate an instant, did not
look away. She went straight forward
with her hands full of bunches of red poppies,
and devouring him with those black
eyes of hers.</p>

<p>"Ah! a curse on your soul!" stammered
Nanni.</p>

ASS.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hey had bought it at the Fair of
Buccheri when it was still a young
colt, and if it caught sight of a she ass, it
would run to it and try to nurse; for this
reason, it had got blows and kicks on its
rump, and it was all in vain for them to
shout "<i>arricca</i>"&mdash;get up&mdash;to it.</p>

<p><i>Compare</i> Neli, when he saw how lively
and obstinate it was, and how it licked its
nostrils when the blows fell, and how it
kept wagging its ears, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's the one for me."</p>

<p>And he went straight up to the proprietor,
with his hand in his pocket on
thirty-five <i>lire</i>.</p>

<p>"The colt is handsome," said the proprietor,
"and is worth more than thirty-five
<i>lire</i>. No matter if it has a white and black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
skin like a magpie. There, I'll show you
its mother; we keep her over yonder in
that little grove, because the colt's all the
time wanting to nurse. You shall see
what a pretty dark hide it's got! Why,
she does more work for me than a mule
would, and has given me more colts than
she has hairs on her back. My conscience!
I don't know where this colt got
its magpie coat. But it is well built, I tell
you. Even men aren't judged by their
moustaches. Look, what a chest! and
what thick, solid legs! See how it holds
its ears. An ass that holds its ears up like
that can be put in a cart or to a plow as
you please, and it will carry four bushels of
corn better than a mule, I swear it will&mdash;by
all the saints. Just feel that tail&mdash;strong
enough to hold up you and all your
kith and kin."</p>

<p><i>Compare</i> Neli knew that as well as the
other, but he wasn't dunce enough to say
so, and he stood with his hand in his
pocket, shrugging his shoulders and making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
grimaces while the proprietor of the
colt made it turn round before them.</p>

<p>"Huh!" grunted <i>compare</i> Neli, "with a
skin like that, it looks like Saint Joseph's
ass. Animals of that color are always
<i>vigliacche</i>,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and when you ride them about,
people laugh in your face. Am I going to
be made a laughing stock for a Saint
Joseph's ass?"</p>

<p>It was the <i>padrone's</i> turn to turn his
back on him in a passion, screaming that
some people didn't know a good animal
when they saw one, and if they hadn't any
money to buy with, they'd better not come
to the fair, and waste good Christian's
time&mdash;on a saint's day, too.</p>

<p><i>Compare</i> Neli let him fume away, and he
went off with his brother, who pulled the
sleeve of his jacket, and whispered in his
ear, that if he was going to throw away his
money on that good-for-nothing animal he
would deserve to be kicked.</p>

<p>While the <i>padrone</i> pretended to be shelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
some young beans, holding the halter
between his legs, <i>compare</i> Neli, not really
losing sight of the Saint Joseph's ass, went
off on a tour of inspection among the mules
and horses, now and again stopping to
criticise or even haggle over the price of
this one or of that among the better animals;
but he did not open his hand, which
still clasped safely in his pocket the thirty-five
<i>lire</i> as if it were going to buy half the
fair. But his brother kept telling him in a
whisper, pointing to the ass, which they
called Saint Joseph's,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's the one for us."</p>

<p>The ass's mistress, every once in a while,
came over to her husband to see how business
was progressing, and when she saw
him sitting with the halter in his hand, she
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Isn't the Madonna going to send a
purchaser for the foal, to-day?"</p>

<p>And the husband would always reply in
these terms,&mdash;</p>

<p>"None yet! One's been here bargaining,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
and he liked it. But he objected to
the price, and went off again with the
money in his pocket. There he is, over
yonder with the white cap, beyond that
flock of sheep. He hasn't bought anything
yet; that means, he'll be back
again."</p>

<p>The woman was about to squat down on
a couple of stones near her foal, to see
whether it would be sold or not. But her
husband said to her,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Off with you. If they see you are
waiting, they won't finish the bargain."</p>

<p>Meantime the foal was nosing about
between the legs of several she-asses that
were passing by. It wanted to nurse, for
it was half starved. It was just opening
its mouth to bray when the <i>padrone</i> reduced
it to silence by a shower of blows
because they had not wanted it.</p>

<p>"It's still there," said <i>compare</i> Neli in
his brother's ear, pretending to turn round
and look for something. "If we wait till
the Ave Maria, we may be able to get it for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
five <i>lire</i> cheaper than the price that we
offered."</p>

<p>The May sunshine was warm so that
gradually amid all the noise and bustle of
the fair a great silence followed throughout
the whole field, as if no one were there:
then it was that the mistress of the young
ass came to her husband again and said:</p>

<p>"I wouldn't hold out for five <i>lire</i> more
or less, for to-night we have not enough to
buy our supper and you know well that the
foal will eat his head off in a month if he
remains on our hands."</p>

<p>"If you don't go off," replied her husband,
"I'll give you a kick that you'll
remember."</p>

<p class="p2">Thus passed the hours at the fair; but
of all those who passed in front of the
Saint Joseph's ass not one stopped to look
at it, and that, too, though the <i>padrone</i> had
chosen the most humble place near the
animals of small value, so that with its
magpie skin it might not be compared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
with the beautiful bay mules and the sleek
horses! Some one like <i>compare</i> Neli was
wanted to buy his Saint Joseph's ass, at
the sight of which every one at the fair
was laughing.</p>

<p>The colt, after such a long waiting in
the sun, let his head and ears hang down;
his <i>padrone</i> went and squatted on the
stones, with his hands also hanging between
his knees and the halter in his
hands, gazing at the long shadows that
began to be cast across the plain from
the sun, which was preparing to set, and
at the legs of all those animals that had
not as yet found purchasers.</p>

<p>Just then <i>compare</i> Neli and his brother,
and a friend of theirs whom they had
picked up for the occasion, came sauntering
by, with their noses in the air; but the
owner of the young ass turned his head
aside so as not to seem to be on the look
out for them. And <i>compare</i> Neli's friend,
squinting up his eyes, remarked as if the
idea had just occurred to him:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p>"O, see that Saint Joseph's ass! Why
don't you buy that one, <i>compare</i> Neli?"</p>

<p>"I bargained it this morning; but he
asks too much for it. Besides, I should be
the laughing stock of the town if I were
seen with that black and white beast.
You see no one has had a thought of
buying it so far."</p>

<p>"That's so, but the color makes no
difference in the use that you make of
one."</p>

<p>And turning to the <i>padrone</i> he asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How much must we pay for that Saint
Joseph's ass of yours?"</p>

<p>The mistress of the Saint Joseph's ass,
seeing that the business was on once more,
had quietly approached, with her hands
clasped under her apron.</p>

<p>"Don't speak to me of it," cried <i>compare</i>
Neli making off across the field. "Don't
speak of it again, I don't want to hear a
word."</p>

<p>"If you don't want it, let it be," replied
the <i>padrone</i>. "If he does not take it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
some one else will. 'A sad wretch is he
who has nothing left to sell after the fair.'"</p>

<p>"And I will be heard, <i>santo diavolone</i>!"
screamed the friend. "Can't I be permitted
to have my say?"</p>

<p>And he ran and caught <i>compare</i> Neli by
the jacket, then he came back and whispered
something in the <i>padrone's</i> ear as the
man was about to return home with his
young ass, and he flung his arm round his
neck, murmuring,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look here! five <i>lire</i> more or less, and
if you don't sell it to-day you won't find
another blunderhead like my <i>compare</i> to
buy a beast, which between you and me,
isn't worth a cigar!"</p>

<p>He also embraced the young ass's mistress,
whispered in her ear to win her to his
way of thinking. But she shrugged her
shoulders and replied with stern face,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Tis my husband's business: I don't
mix myself in it. But if he lets it go for
less than forty <i>lire</i> he is a dunce, and that's
what I say. It cost us more than that."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p>"This morning I was crazy when I offered
him thirty-five <i>lire</i>," resumed <i>compare</i>
Neli. "Has he found any other purchaser
even at that price? I reckon not. In the
whole fair there aren't more than four
scabby rams and the Saint Joseph's ass.
I'll give thirty <i>lire</i> if he'll take it."</p>

<p>"Take it," softly whispered the young
ass's mistress to her husband, and the tears
came into her eyes. "We haven't made
enough this evening to buy our supper, and
Turiddu has the fever again; he'll have to
have quinine."</p>

<p>"<i>Santo diavolone!</i>" screamed her husband,
"if you don't get away from here I'll
give you a taste of this halter."</p>

<p>"Thirty-two and a half, there now!"
cried the friend at last, giving him a powerful
shake to the collar.</p>

<p>"Neither you nor I! This time my advice
ought to hold, by all the saints in paradise!
and I don't even ask for a glass of
wine. Don't you see the sun is set? What
is the use of you both holding out any
longer?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<p>And he snatched the halter from the <i>padrone's</i>
hand, while, at the same time, <i>compare</i>
Neli with an oath took out of his pocket his
closed fist clutching the thirty-five <i>lire</i>, and
gave them to the man without looking at
them as if they took his liver with them.
The friend retired to one side with the mistress
of the young ass to count over the
money on a rock, while the <i>padrone</i> went
off to another part of the fair like a colt,
cursing and beating himself with his fists.</p>

<p>But when he was at last rejoined by his
wife, who was carefully recounting the
money in her handkerchief, he demanded,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you got it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the whole of it; praised be San
Gaetano!<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Now I'll go to the apothecary's."</p>

<p>"I got the best of them! I'd have let
them have the beast for twenty <i>lire</i>; asses
of that color are <i>vigliacchi</i>&mdash;vile."</p>

<p>And <i>compare</i> Neli, as he got behind the
ass to drive it off, said,&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>"As God exists I robbed him of the colt!
The color makes no difference. See what
solid legs, <i>compare</i>! That beast is worth
forty <i>lire</i> with one's eyes shut."</p>

<p>"If it had not been for me," returned
the friend, "you would not have struck the
bargain. Here are still two <i>lire</i> and a half
of your money. And if you don't object
we will go and have a drink to the health
of the ass!"</p>

<p>Now the colt needed to have its health
in order to repay the thirty-two and a half
<i>lire</i> which had been paid for it, and the
straw which it ate. Meanwhile it was contented
to frisk behind <i>compare</i> Neli, trying
to bite his new <i>padrone's</i> coat tails, and making
no ado because it was leaving forever
the stall where it had been sheltered by its
mother's side, free to rub its nose on the
edge of the manger, or to gambol and cut
up capers, butting with the ram or going to
rub the pig's back in its pen.</p>

<p>And the <i>padrone</i>, who was still again
counting over the money in her handkerchief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
before the apothecary's counter, had
on her side no regrets, although she had
assisted at the birth of the foal with its
black and white skin, as shiny as silk, and
which could not at first stand up on its
legs, but lay in the warm sun in the court-yard
while all the grass which had made it
grow so big and strong had passed through
her hands!</p>

<p>The only person who missed the foal was
its mother, who stretched out her neck
toward the entrance of the stall and brayed.
But when her udder was no longer painfully
distended with the milk, she also forgot
about the foal.</p>

<p>"Now you will see," said <i>compare</i> Neli,
"that this ass will carry four bushels of
corn better than a mule, for me."</p>

<p>And at harvest time he was set to
threshing.</p>

<p>At the threshing, the colt, fastened by
the neck, in a row with other animals&mdash;worn
out mules, decrepit horses, paced
over the sheaves, from morning till night,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
so that when it was brought back to the
stable, he was so tired that he had no
desire to bite at the heap of straw where
they put him up in the shade when the
wind blew, while the peasants did their
winnowing with shouts of "<i>Viva Maria!</i>"</p>

<p>Then he let his nose hang down and
drooped his pendent ears, like a full-fledged
ass with eyes dulled, as if he were weary of
gazing across over that vast plain, smoking
here and there with the dust of the threshing-floors,
and he seemed made for nothing
else than to die of thirst and enforced
treading on sheaves.</p>

<p>At eventide, it was sent to the village
with the saddle-bags filled full, and the
<i>padrone's</i> boy followed, to prick it in the
withers, along the hedges lining the road,
that seemed alive with the chattering of
the tomtits, and the odor of the catnip and
rosemary; and the ass would gladly have
snatched a mouthful, if they had not
always kept it on the go, until at last, the
blood ran to its legs and they had to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
it to the farrier; but this did not trouble
the <i>padrone</i>, because the harvest was good,
and the young ass had earned its cost,&mdash;his
thirty-two <i>lire</i> and a half. The <i>padrone</i>
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, the work has worn him out, but
if I could sell him for twenty <i>lire</i>, I should
still have made a good thing out of him."</p>

<p>The only person who had a fondness for
the young ass was the boy who made it
trot over the road on the way from the
threshing-floor. And he felt badly when
the farrier burnt its legs with red-hot
irons, so that the young ass squirmed and
flung its tail into the air, and pricked up
its ears, and when it ran across the field of
the fair, and it tried to break loose from the
twisted rope which they fastened to its lip,
and it rolled its eyes with the agony, as if
it were undergoing torture, when the farrier's
apprentice came to change the hot
irons, red as fire, and the skin smoked and
sizzled, like fish in a frying-pan. But
<i>compare</i> Neli cried to his boy,&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>"You beast! what are you weeping
for? Now that he is played out, and
since the harvest has been a good one,
we'll sell him and buy a mule, and that
will be better."</p>

<p>Boys do not understand some things,
and after the young ass was sold to <i>massaro</i>
Cirino, of Licodiana, <i>compare</i> Neli's
son used to visit it in the stall, and to
caress its face and neck, and the ass would
turn round its head, and snuff as if it had
become attached to him, while, as a general
thing, asses are made to be tied wherever
their <i>padrone</i> may see fit to tie them, and
change their lot as they change their stall.</p>

<p><i>Massaro</i> Cirino, of Licodiana, had paid
a very small price for the Saint Joseph's
ass, because it still bore the scars on its
pastern, and <i>compare</i> Neli's wife, when she
saw the poor beast go by with its new
master, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That beast was our mascot. That
black and white skin brought joy to the
threshing-floor, and now the profits are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
going from bad to worse, for we have had
to sell the mule, too."</p>

<p class="p2"><i>Massaro</i> Cirino had yoked the ass to the
plow, together with an old mare which
matched it like a stone in a ring, and drew
her brave furrow all day long, for miles and
miles, from the time the lark began to sing
in the clear morning sky, till, with quick
and hasty flights, and melancholy chirping,
the robin red-breasts ran to hide behind
the naked bushes, trembling with cold
under the mist that rose like a sea.</p>

<p>Only, as the ass was smaller than the
mare, a cushion of hay was put over the
saddle under the yoke, and it had hard
work to break up the frozen clods, by dint
of chafed shoulders.</p>

<p>"It'll help spare the mare, who's getting
old," said <i>massaro</i> Cirino. "It's got a
heart as broad and big as the Plain of
Catania, that Saint Joseph's ass has! and
you would not think it!"</p>

<p>And he added, turning to his wife, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
had followed him, wrapped in a mantellina,
penuriously scattering the seed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If anything should happen to it&mdash;Heaven
forefend&mdash;we are ruined with the
prospects before us."</p>

<p>The woman looked forward to the prospects
of crops in the rocky, desolate, little
field, with its white and cracked soil, so
long had it been since the rain fell, and all
the water it got came in the form of mist
and fog, of the kind that spoils the seed,
and when it was time to dig up the ground,
it was so yellow and hard, that you would
call it the very beard of the devil, as if it
had been burnt with sulphur matches!</p>

<p>"In spite of the crop which I put in,"
mourned <i>massaro</i> Cirino, pulling off his
doublet, "why, that ass has worked himself
to death like a stupid mule. That ass is
under a curse!"</p>

<p>His wife had a lump in her throat at the
sight of the parched field, and she replied
with tears rolling from her eyes,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The ass had nothing to do with the failure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
It brought a good crop to <i>compare</i>
Neli. But we are unfortunate."</p>

<p>So the Saint Joseph's ass changed masters
once more, when <i>massaro</i> Cirino returned
from the field with the sickle over
his shoulder, it being useless even to try to
reap that year, although the images of the
saints had been stuck into bamboo sticks
all over the ground for protection, and two
<i>tarì</i><a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> had been paid to the priest for his
blessing.</p>

<p>"It's the devil that we want rather than
the saints," said <i>massaro</i> Cirino, irreverently,
when he saw all those stalks standing
up like crests, which even the ass refused to
touch, and he spat up towards that turquoise-colored
sky, so relentlessly cloudless.</p>

<p>It was then that <i>compare</i> Luciano, the
carter, meeting <i>massaro</i> Cirino, as he was
driving back the ass with empty saddlebags,
asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What'll you take for that Saint Joseph's
ass?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>"Anything you'll give me! Cursed be
he and the saint who made him!" replied
<i>massaro</i> Cirino. "Now we haven't any
more bread to eat, or fodder to give the
beast."</p>

<p>"I'll give you fifteen <i>lire</i> for it, seeing
that you are ruined, but the ass isn't worth
so much, for it won't last out more than
six months! See how thin it is!"</p>

<p>"You might have got more than that,"
grumbled <i>massaro</i> Cirino's wife, after the
bargain was settled. "<i>Compare</i> Luciano's
mule's dead, and he hadn't money enough
to buy another. Now if he hadn't bought
our Saint Joseph's ass, he wouldn't have
known what to do with his cart and harnesses;
you'll see that ass'll be a fortune
to him."</p>

<p>The ass was set to work drawing the
cart, but the shafts of it were much too
high for it, and brought all the weight on
its shoulders, so that it would not have
survived even six months; for it went
limping along over the hilly roads under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
<i>compare</i> Luciano's cruel cudgelling, who
tried to put a little spirit into it; and when
it went down hill, the case was even worse,
for then the whole load rested on it, and
pushed against it so hard that it had to
make its back like an arch to hold the cart
back, and push with those poor scarred
legs, and people would laugh to see it, and
when it fell it would have taken all the
angels of Paradise to get it to its feet
again. But <i>compare</i> Luciano knew that he
carried three quintals of merchandise more
than a mule, and the load would bring him
five <i>tarì</i> a quintal.</p>

<p>"Every day that Saint Joseph's ass
lives," said he, "I make fifteen <i>tarì</i>, and
his keep costs me less than a mule's
would."</p>

<p>Every time the people who happened
to be sauntering along behind the cart saw
the poor beast, which could hardly put one
leg in front of the other, arching its spine
and panting heavily, with discouragement
clouding its eye, they would say,&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>"Block the wheel with a rock, and let
that poor creature have a chance to get its
breath."</p>

<p>But <i>compare</i> Luciano would reply,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I let him do as he pleases, I should
not make my fifteen <i>tarì</i> a day. His hide's
got to pay for mine. When he can't do
any more work I shall sell him to the lime
dealer; for the beast is good enough for
his work. I tell you there's no truth at
all in the idea that St. Joseph's asses are
<i>vigliacchi</i>. Besides, I got this one of
<i>massaro</i> Cirino for a piece of bread, after
he was 'poverished."</p>

<p class="p2">In this way the Saint Joseph's ass
passed into the hands of the lime-dealer,
who already possessed a score or more of
asses all lean and moribund, which carried
his sacks of plaster, and picked up a
wretched living by means of the mouthfuls
of weeds that they could snatch as
they went along the road.</p>

<p>The lime-dealer objected to the Saint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Joseph's ass because it was covered with
worse scars than his other beasts, with its
legs seared by the hot iron, and the skin
on its chest worn off by the poitrel, and
the withers raw by the chafing of the plow,
and the knees barked by constant falls,
and then that pelt of black and white
seemed to him so inharmonious among his
other brown-skinned animals.</p>

<p>"That makes no difference," replied
<i>compare</i> Luciano. "Besides, it will serve
to distinguish your asses at a distance."</p>

<p>But he deducted two <i>tarì</i> from the seven
<i>lire</i> that he had asked, so as to bring the
business to a settlement.</p>

<p>Now the Saint Joseph's ass would not
have been recognized even by the <i>padrona</i>
who had been present when it was born,
so greatly had it changed as it stumbled
along with its nose to the ground and its
ears curled over like an umbrella under
the lime-dealer's heavy sacks, twitching its
flanks under the blows of the youth who
drove the caravan. But then the <i>padrona</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
herself was changed at that time, what with
the bad harvests they had gathered and
the hunger from which she had suffered,
and the fevers which they had all contracted
in the low lands, she and her
husband and her Turiddu, while they had
no money to buy any more quinine at the
apothecary's and at the same time they had
no more asses even of the Saint Joseph
kind to sell for the small price of thirty-five
<i>lire</i>!</p>

<p>In winter, when there was little work
and the wood for burning the lime was
scarce, and to be had only at a distance,
and the frozen paths hadn't a leaf on their
hedges or a mouthful of stubble along by
the icy gutters, life was still harder for
those poor brutes, and the <i>padrone</i> knew
that in winter not half as much was eaten;
so he used to buy a good stock of provisions
in the spring.</p>

<p>At night the drove remained in the open
air near the lime-burners, and the brutes
clustered together for protection against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
the cold. But those stars shining like
swords through and through them in spite
of their thick hides, and all those ulcer-eaten
beasts shook and trembled in the
cold as if they were human beings.</p>

<p>But then there are many Christians who
are not better off, not having even such a
ragged coat as that wrapt up in which the
herd-boy slept before the furnace.</p>

<p>Near by there lived a poor widow in a
dilapidated hut, more tumble-down by far
than the lime-furnace, and through its roof
the stars penetrated like swords, as if it
were no roof at all, and the wind fluttered
the wretched rags of her covering. At
first she took in washing, but that was
meagre pay, for the people thereabouts do
their own washing, when they wash at all,
and now that her little boy had grown she
went about peddling wood in the village.
No one had known her husband and no
one knew where she got the wood that she
sold; that was known only by her son,
who went about picking it up here and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
there at the risk of getting shot by the
<i>campieri</i>.</p>

<p>"If you only had an ass!" the lime-dealer
had said to her, hoping that he
might dispose of that Saint Joseph's ass,
which was good for nothing more, "then
you could take down to the village much
bigger fagots, now that your son is getting
to be grown up."</p>

<p>The poor woman had a few <i>lire</i> in the
knot of her handkerchief, and she let herself
be persuaded into it by the lime-burner,
because it is said that "old things
go to destruction in the house of a fool."</p>

<p>One thing at least was true: the poor
Saint Joseph's ass had a more endurable
existence at last, because the widow regarded
it as a treasure by reason of the
few <i>soldi</i> that it had cost her, and she
went out nights in search of straw and hay
for it, and she kept it in her hut next her
own bed because its vital heat was as good
as a fire, and in this way one hand washed
the other, as the proverb has it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>The woman driving the ass loaded with
a mountain of wood so that its ears could
not be seen, built air-castles as she went,
and her son ravaged the hedges, and risked
his life in the borders of the woodlands to
gather together his load, while both mother
and son had an idea that they were going
to become rich by that business, until,
finally, the baron's <i>campiere</i> caught the boy
breaking off branches, and gave him a terrible
beating.</p>

<p>The doctor, for the price of curing the
lad, devoured all the spare <i>soldi</i> knotted in
the handkerchief, the store of wood, and
whatever else vendible she had,&mdash;and that
was not much in all conscience,&mdash;so that
the widow one night when her son was in
a raging fever, with his face turned to the
wall, and there was not a mouthful of bread
in the house, went out, raging and talking
to herself, as if she, too, had the fever, and
she went to break off an almond-tree near
by in such a way that it would not appear
how it happened, and at dawn she loaded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
it on the ass to go and sell it. But the ass
on the way up stumbled under the weight,
and went down on its knees, just as Saint
Joseph's ass knelt before the infant Jesus,
and would not get up again.</p>

<p>"Souls of the dead!" stammered the
woman, "won't you carry this load of wood
for me."</p>

<p>And the passers-by pulled the ass's tail,
and they bit its ears, so as to make it get
up.</p>

<p>"Don't you see it's dying?" at last remarked
a carter, and so at least the others
let it alone, because the ass had the eye of
a dead fish, a cold nose, and a shudder ran
over its skin.</p>

<p>The woman, meantime, thought of her
son, who was delirious with fever, and a
flushed face, and cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now what shall we do,&mdash;what shall
we do?"</p>

<p>"If you will sell it, and all the wood on
its back for five <i>tarì</i>, I'll give that much,"
said the carter who had an empty cart; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
as the woman looked at it with squinting
eyes, he added, "I'll only take the wood,
for the ass isn't worth that&mdash;"</p>

<p>And he gave a kick to the carcass, which
sounded like a burst drum.</p>

<p class="center p6"><span class="b1">THE BEREAVED.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he little girl appeared at the door,
twisting the corner of her apron in
her fingers, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here I am!"</p>

<p>Then, when no one paid any attention to
her, she looked shyly first at one and then
at another of the women who were kneading
dough, and spoke again,&mdash;</p>

<p>"They told me,&mdash;'Go to <i>comare</i> Sidora.'"</p>

<p>"Come here, come here," cried <i>comare</i>
Sidora, red as a tomato, as she stood in the
back part of the bake-shop. "Wait a
moment, and I'll make you a nice cake."</p>

<p>"It means they are bringing <i>comare</i>
Nunzia the Viaticum; they've sent the
little girl away," observed the woman from
Lacodia.</p>

<p>One of the women engaged in kneading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the dough, turned her head, with her hands
still at work in the trough, her arms bare
to the elbow, and asked the little girl,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How is your step-mother?"</p>

<p>The child, not knowing the woman,
looked at her with frightened eyes, and
hanging her head, and nervously working
at the ends of her apron, said, in a low
voice, between her set teeth,&mdash;</p>

<p>"She's in bed."</p>

<p>"Don't you see 'tis the Sacrament,"
replied la Licodiana. "Now the neighbors
have begun to scream at the door."</p>

<p>"As soon as I finish kneading this
dough," said <i>comare</i> Sidora, "I'll run over
a moment to see if they have need of anything.
<i>Compare</i> Meno loses his right hand
when this second wife of his dies."</p>

<p>"Some men have no luck with their
wives, just as some are unfortunate with
their mules. No sooner do they get 'em
than they lose 'em. There's <i>comare</i> Angela."</p>

<p>"Yesterday evening," observed la Licodiana,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
"I saw <i>compare</i> Meno at his door;
he had come back from the vineyard before
the Ave Marie, and was blowing his nose
on his handkerchief."</p>

<p>"But," suggested the woman who was
kneading the dough, "he is a master hand
at killing off his wives. In less than three
years already two of <i>curátolo</i><a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Nino's
daughters have been eaten up, one after
the other! Wait a little and you'll see
the third go the same way, and all <i>curátolo</i>
Nino's things wasted."</p>

<p>"Is this little girl <i>comare</i> Nunzia's
daughter, or his first wife's?"</p>

<p>"She's his first wife's daughter. But this
one has been just as kind to her as though
she had been her own mamma, because
the little orphan was her niece, you know."</p>

<p>The child, hearing them speaking of
herself, began to weep silently in a corner,
thus relieving her bursting heart,
which she had till then kept under control,
by playing with her apron.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>

<p>"Come here, come here," pursued <i>comare</i>
Sidora. "The nice cake's all ready.
There, there! Don't cry; for your mamma's
in Paradise."</p>

<p>The little girl then dried her eyes with her
doubled fists, because she saw that <i>comare</i>
Sidora was preparing to open the oven.</p>

<p>"Poor <i>comare</i> Nunzia!" said a neighbor,
appearing at the door. "The gravediggers
are on their way. They just passed
by here."</p>

<p>"Heaven protect me! as I am under
Mary's grace!"<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> exclaimed the women,
crossing themselves.</p>

<p><i>Comare</i> Sidora took the cake out of the
oven, brushed off the ashes, and handed it,
smoking hot, to the little girl, who took it
in her apron and walked away slowly,
slowly, blowing on it as she went.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" cried <i>comare</i>
Sidora. "Stay here! There's a black-faced
<i>ba-bau</i> at your house who carries
folks off."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<p>The little orphan listened gravely, with
wide-opened eyes. Then she replied in
the same obstinate drawl,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am going to carry it to my mamma."</p>

<p>"Your mamma is dead; stay here," said
one of the neighbors. "Eat your cake."</p>

<p>Then the little girl squatted down on the
door-step, the image of sadness, holding
her cake in her hand without offering to
eat it.</p>

<p>Then suddenly seeing "<i>il babbo</i>" coming,
she jumped up joyously and ran to
meet him.</p>

<p><i>Compare</i> Meno entered without saying
a word, and sat down in a corner, with his
hands dangling between his knees, with a
long face, and his lips as white as paper;
for since the day before, he had not put a
morsel of food into his mouth because of
his grief. He looked at the women as if to
say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Poveretto me!</i>"</p>

<p>Seeing the black handkerchief around
his neck, the women, with their hands still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
pasted with dough, made a circle round
him and condoled with him in chorus.</p>

<p>"Don't speak of it to me, <i>comare</i>
Sidora," he exclaimed, shaking his head,
and heaving up his great shoulders.
"This is a thorn that will never be pulled
out of my heart. That woman was a real
saint! I did not deserve her, saving your
presence. Only day before yesterday,
when she was so sick, she got up to tend
to the weaning colt, and she would not let
me call in the doctor, or buy any medicine,
either&mdash;so as to not waste any
money. I sha'n't find another wife like
her. No I sha'n't, I tell you. Let me
weep&mdash;I've good reason to."</p>

<p>And he began to shake his head and
to heave his shoulders as if his misfortune
were a burden not to be borne.</p>

<p>"As to getting another wife," said la
Licodiana, to encourage him, "all you've
got to do is to look for one."</p>

<p>"No! no!" asseverated <i>compare</i> Meno,
with his head hung low, like a mule's.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
"Such another wife is not to be had.
This time I shall remain a widower. I
tell you I shall."</p>

<p><i>Comare</i> Sidora interrupted him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't say foolish things like that. You
must get another wife, if only for the sake
of this little orphan girl; for otherwise, who
will look out for her when you are out
working? You wouldn't let her run in
the streets, would you?"</p>

<p>"Then find me another wife like my last
one! She would not wash herself, for fear
of soiling the water; and at home, she
served me better than a farm-hand&mdash;affectionate
and faithful. Why, she would not
take even a handful of beans from the rack,
or ever open her mouth to ask for anything.
And beside, a fine dowry&mdash;things
as good as gold. And I've got to give
it all back because she had no children.
At least, so the sacristan says, when he
came with the Holy Water. And how
kind she was to the little girl who reminded
her of her poor sister. Any other woman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
except an aunt, would have cast an evil
eye on her, the poor little orphan!</p>

<p>"If you asked <i>curátolo</i> Nino for his third
daughter, it would make things all right,
both for the orphan and for the dowry,"
suggested la Licodiana.</p>

<p>"That's what I say. But don't speak
of it to me, for now my mouth is bitter as
gall."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't talk about it now," said
<i>comare</i> Sidora. "Eat a bit of something,
<i>compare</i> Meno. You are all tired out."</p>

<p>"No! no!" returned <i>compare</i> Meno several
times. "Don't speak to me of eating,
for I have a lump in my throat."</p>

<p><i>Comare</i> Sidora placed before him on a
stool fresh bread with ripe olives, a piece
of sheep's-head cheese, and a jug of wine.
And the poor clumsy fellow set to work
nibbling at it, all the time grumbling, with
a long face.</p>

<p>"Such bread as she made," he observed
with a quaver in his voice, "no one else
could ever make. Just as if it were made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
of real meal. And with a handful of wild
fennel, she would make a soup to lick your
fingers over! Now I shall have to buy
bread at the shop of that thief, <i>mastro</i>
Puddo; and as for hot soup, I sha'n't have
any more, when I come home wet as a
fresh-hatched chicken. And I shall have
to go to bed with a cold stomach. Only
the other night, while I was watching with
her, after I had been digging and grubbing
all day on the hill, and caught myself snoring
as I sat next the bed, so tired I was,
the poor soul said to me: 'Go and get a
mouthful of something to eat. I left the
soup to keep hot on the hearth.' And she
was always thinking about my comfort,
and about the house, and whatever was to
be done, and this thing and that thing; and
she could not come to an end of speaking
or of giving her last directions, like one
who is going off on a long journey, and I
heard her constantly muttering between
waking and sleeping. And how contentedly
she went off to the other world! With
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
the crucifix on her breast, and her hands
folded over it. She has no need of Masses
and rosaries, saint that she was. Money
spent on the priest would be money thrown
away."</p>

<p>"World of tribulation!" exclaimed a
neighbor. "<i>Comare</i> Angela's ass is like to
die of the colic."</p>

<p>"But my misfortunes are heavier," ended
<i>compare</i> Meno, wiping his mouth with the
back of his hand. "No, don't make me
eat any more, for the mouthfuls fall like
lumps of lead into my stomach. You eat
something, you poor innocent, for you
don't understand what you've lost. Now
you have no one any longer to wash you
and brush your hair. Now you haven't a
mamma any more to shelter you under her
wings like a setting hen, and you are ruined,
as I am. I found her for you, but a second
stepmother like her you won't get, my
daughter!"</p>

<p>The child with bursting heart put up her
lip again, and stuck her fists into her eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>"No, you can't possibly get along alone,"
interposed <i>comare</i> Sidora. "You must find
another wife for the sake of this poor little
motherless girl, left in the midst of the
street."</p>

<p>"And how shall I get along? And my
colt? And my house? And who'll look
after the hens? Let me weep, <i>comare</i>
Sidora! It would have been better if I
had died instead of that good soul."</p>

<p>"Hush, hush! you don't know what you
are saying, and you don't know what a
house without its head is!"</p>

<p>"That is true," assented <i>compare</i> Meno,
comforted.</p>

<p>"Just take example from poor <i>comare</i>
Angela! First, her husband died; then
her grown-up son, and now her ass is also
dying."</p>

<p>"The ass ought to be bled in the belly,
if it has the colic," said <i>compare</i> Meno.</p>

<p>"Come, you know all about such things,"
suggested the neighbor. "Do a work of
charity for the sake of your wife's soul."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p><i>Compare</i> Meno got up to go to <i>comare</i>
Angela's, and the little orphan ran behind
him like a chicken, now that she had no
one else in the world. <i>Comare</i> Sidora,
good housewife that she was, called him
back.</p>

<p>"And the house? How have you left
it, now that there is no one there to look
after it?"</p>

<p>"I locked the door, and besides cousin
Alfia lives opposite, and will keep an eye
on it."</p>

<p>Neighbor Angela's ass lay stretched
out in the midst of the yard, with his
muzzle cold and his ears hanging, every
now and then kicking his four legs into
the air whenever the colic made him draw
in his sides like a pair of bellows. The
widow crouching in front of him on the
rocks, with her hands clenching her gray
hair, and her eyes dry and despairing,
was watching him, pale as a corpse.</p>

<p><i>Compare</i> Meno man&oelig;uvred round the
animal, touching his ears, looking into his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
lifeless eyes, and when he saw that the
blood was still oozing from the punctured
vein under the belly, drop by drop, and
coagulating in a black mass on his hairy
skin, he remarked:</p>

<p>"So you've had him bled, have you?"</p>

<p>The widow fixed her dark eyes on his
face without speaking, and nodded her
"yes."</p>

<p>"Then there's nothing more to do," said
<i>compare</i> Meno, and he continued to stare
at the ass, which stretched itself out on
the stones, stiffly, with its hair all rumpled,
like a dead cat.</p>

<p>"It is God's will, sister!" said he to
comfort her. "We are ruined, both of
us!"</p>

<p>He had gone round by the widow's side
and squatted down on the stones, with his
little daughter between his knees, and both
of them continued to gaze at the poor
beast, which from time to time threshed
the air with its legs as if it were in the
agonies of death.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p><i>Comare</i> Sidora, when she had got the
bread safely out of the oven, also came
into the yard with the cousin Alfia, who
had put on her new gown and wore her
silk handkerchief on her head, all ready
for a bit of gossip, and <i>comare</i> Sidora said
to <i>compare</i> Meno, drawing him aside,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Curátolo</i> Nino won't give you his third
daughter, for at your house the women die
off like flies, and he loses the dowry.
And then la Santa is too young, and
there's the risk that she'd fill your house
with children."</p>

<p>"If only one could be sure of boys!
But there's always the danger of girls
coming. Oh, I am so unfortunate!"</p>

<p>"Well, there's the cousin Alfia. She is
no longer young, and she has property,&mdash;the
house and a bit of vineyard."</p>

<p><i>Compare</i> Meno fixed his eyes on the
cousin Alfia, who with her arms a-kimbo
was pretending to look at the ass, and then
he said, "That's so! One might think of
that. But I am so very unlucky!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<p><i>Comare</i> Sidora interrupted him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Think of those who are more unlucky
than you are!"</p>

<p>"No one is, I tell you. I shall never
find another wife like her, I shall never be
able to forget her, even if I married ten
times. And this poor little orphan will
never forget her, either."</p>

<p>"Calm yourself! You'll forget her fast
enough. And the little girl will forget her,
too. Didn't she forget her own mother?
But just look at poor neighbor Angela,
whose ass is dying, and she hasn't got
anything else. She'll never be able to
forget it."</p>

<p><i>Comare</i> Alfia saw that it was a favorable
moment for her to approach, and drawing
a long face, she began to eulogize the
dead woman. She had with her own
hands helped to lay her out on the bier,
and had put over her face a fine linen
handkerchief, of which she had a goodly
store, as may be imagined.</p>

<p>Then <i>compare</i> Meno, with his heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
melting within him, turned to his neighbor
Angela, who was sitting motionless, as if
she had been turned to stone.</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll have the ass skinned
won't you? At least get some money for
his pelt."</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
